# Epic 2: Real-Time Monitoring Interface

## Epic Intent
Implement a web-based real-time monitoring interface that allows users to observe SSH session activity through their browser, providing live terminal output and session management capabilities.

## Story 1: Web Server Infrastructure
As a developer using the SSH MCP server, I want a local web server that serves monitoring interfaces so that I can access session monitoring through my browser.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the MCP server is running
- **When** the web server component starts
- **Then** a local HTTP server is available on a configurable port (default: 8080)
- **And** the server serves static HTML/CSS/JS files for the monitoring interface
- **And** the server provides WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication
- **And** the server handles multiple concurrent browser connections
- **And** the server starts automatically when the MCP server starts
- **And** the server shuts down gracefully when the MCP server stops

**Performance Requirements:**
- Web server must start within 3 seconds of MCP server startup
- Server must handle minimum 10 concurrent browser connections

## Story 2: Session URL Generation
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to get monitoring URLs for my SSH sessions so that I can easily access the browser-based monitoring interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an active SSH session exists with a specific name
- **When** I request the monitoring URL for that session
- **Then** a unique URL is generated for the session (format: http://localhost:8080/session/{session-name})
- **And** the URL includes session identification in the path
- **And** the URL is immediately accessible in a browser
- **And** invalid session names return appropriate error messages
- **And** URLs remain valid for the lifetime of the session

## Story 3: Real-Time Terminal Output Display
As a developer monitoring SSH sessions, I want to see live terminal output in my browser so that I can observe command execution in real-time.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a browser is connected to a session monitoring URL
- **When** commands are executed in the SSH session
- **Then** terminal output is displayed in real-time in the browser
- **And** output includes both stdout and stderr streams
- **And** terminal colors and formatting are preserved
- **And** text scrolling behaves like a standard terminal
- **And** historical output is displayed when first connecting
- **And** output updates have latency under 100ms
- **And** special characters and escape sequences render properly

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use xterm.js for terminal emulation in browser
- Implement WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
- Support VT100/ANSI terminal escape sequences

## Story 4: Multi-Session Dashboard
As a developer with multiple SSH sessions, I want a dashboard view that shows all active sessions so that I can monitor multiple connections simultaneously.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** multiple SSH sessions are active
- **When** I access the main monitoring dashboard (http://localhost:8080/)
- **Then** all active sessions are listed with their status indicators
- **And** each session shows: name, host, connection status, last activity time
- **And** session status uses visual indicators: üü¢ connected, üî¥ disconnected, üü° error
- **And** clicking a session name opens the individual session monitor
- **And** the dashboard updates automatically when sessions are added/removed
- **And** connection health is refreshed every 5 seconds

## Story 5: Terminal Interaction Controls
As a developer monitoring SSH sessions, I want basic interaction controls in the browser interface so that I can manage the monitoring experience effectively.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a session monitoring interface is open
- **When** I interact with the terminal display
- **Then** I can scroll through historical output using mouse wheel or scrollbar
- **And** I can copy text from the terminal output
- **And** I can clear the terminal display locally (without affecting remote session)
- **And** I can toggle auto-scroll to bottom for new output
- **And** I can adjust terminal size (columns/rows) for better viewing
- **And** terminal remains responsive during high-output operations

## Story 6: Session Command History Panel
As a developer monitoring SSH sessions, I want to see a history of executed commands so that I can track what operations have been performed.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** commands have been executed in an SSH session
- **When** I view the session monitoring interface
- **Then** a command history panel displays the last 50 executed commands
- **And** each command shows: timestamp, command text, exit code
- **And** successful commands show with ‚úÖ indicator (exit code 0)
- **And** failed commands show with ‚ùå indicator (non-zero exit code)
- **And** long commands are truncated with expandable view
- **And** command history persists for the session lifetime
- **And** history panel is collapsible to save screen space

## Story 7: Browser Connectivity Management
As a developer using the monitoring interface, I want robust connection handling so that I can maintain reliable monitoring even with network interruptions.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** a browser is connected to the monitoring interface
- **When** the WebSocket connection is interrupted
- **Then** the interface displays connection status clearly
- **And** automatic reconnection attempts are made every 5 seconds
- **And** missed output is retrieved upon reconnection
- **And** connection errors are displayed with user-friendly messages
- **And** manual reconnect option is available
- **And** connection status indicator shows: üîó connected, ‚ö†Ô∏è reconnecting, ‚ùå disconnected

**Performance Requirements:**
- Reconnection attempts must begin within 5 seconds of disconnection
- Interface must remain responsive during connection issues
