# Epic 5: File Transfer Operations

## Epic Intent
Implement bidirectional file transfer capabilities between local and remote systems through SSH sessions, enabling efficient code synchronization and development file operations.

## Story 1: Single File Upload Operations
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to upload individual files to remote servers so that I can transfer specific files for testing or deployment.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an active SSH session and a local file exists
- **When** I upload a file to the remote server
- **Then** the file is transferred using SFTP protocol through the SSH session
- **And** the remote directory is created if it doesn't exist
- **And** file permissions are preserved during transfer
- **And** file modification times are preserved
- **And** transfer progress is reported for large files (>1MB)
- **And** existing remote files are overwritten with confirmation
- **And** transfer errors provide specific failure reasons
- **And** partial transfers are cleaned up on failure

**Performance Requirements:**
- Transfer rate must achieve at least 1MB/s on standard connections
- Progress updates every 10% for files larger than 1MB
- Transfer timeout of 5 minutes per 100MB

## Story 2: Single File Download Operations
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to download individual files from remote servers so that I can retrieve logs, configuration files, or generated artifacts.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an active SSH session and a remote file exists
- **When** I download a file from the remote server
- **Then** the file is retrieved using SFTP protocol through the SSH session
- **And** the local directory is created if it doesn't exist
- **And** file permissions are preserved during transfer
- **And** file modification times are preserved
- **And** transfer progress is reported for large files (>1MB)
- **And** existing local files are overwritten with confirmation
- **And** transfer errors provide specific failure reasons
- **And** partial downloads are cleaned up on failure

## Story 3: Directory Upload Operations
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to upload entire directories to remote servers so that I can deploy complete project structures or synchronize code bases.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an active SSH session and a local directory exists
- **When** I upload a directory to the remote server
- **Then** the entire directory structure is transferred recursively
- **And** subdirectories are created as needed on the remote server
- **And** file permissions and timestamps are preserved for all files
- **And** symbolic links are handled appropriately (followed or preserved)
- **And** transfer progress shows overall progress and current file
- **And** .gitignore files are respected to exclude unnecessary files
- **And** hidden files and directories are included unless explicitly excluded
- **And** transfer can be resumed if interrupted

**Performance Requirements:**
- Directory scanning completes within 10 seconds for 1000 files
- Concurrent file transfers (up to 3 simultaneous files)
- Overall progress reporting with ETA calculation

## Story 4: Directory Download Operations
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to download entire directories from remote servers so that I can retrieve complete project backups or generated output directories.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an active SSH session and a remote directory exists
- **When** I download a directory from the remote server
- **Then** the entire directory structure is retrieved recursively
- **And** local subdirectories are created as needed
- **And** file permissions and timestamps are preserved for all files
- **And** symbolic links are handled appropriately
- **And** transfer progress shows overall progress and current file
- **And** large directories can be downloaded without memory exhaustion
- **And** transfer can be resumed if interrupted
- **And** empty directories are preserved in the download

## Story 5: File Transfer Progress and Monitoring
As a developer transferring files, I want detailed progress information so that I can monitor transfer status and estimate completion times.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** file transfer operations are in progress
- **When** transfers are active
- **Then** current transfer progress is displayed as percentage complete
- **And** transfer speed is calculated and displayed (MB/s)
- **And** estimated time remaining is calculated and updated
- **And** current file being transferred is shown for directory operations
- **And** overall progress is shown for multi-file operations
- **And** transfer can be cancelled cleanly without corrupting files
- **And** progress information is available through monitoring interface

**Progress Display Format:**
```
Uploading project/ to /remote/path/
[████████████░░░░░░░░] 65% - 3.2MB/s - ETA: 2m 15s
Current: src/components/Button.tsx (847KB/1.2MB)
Files: 23/35 complete
```

## Story 6: File Synchronization Operations
As a developer maintaining code synchronization, I want intelligent file synchronization so that only changed files are transferred between local and remote systems.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** local and remote directories exist with potentially different content
- **When** I perform synchronization operations
- **Then** file modification times are compared to identify changed files
- **And** file sizes are compared as additional change detection
- **And** only modified, new, or deleted files are processed
- **And** bidirectional sync is supported (local→remote, remote→local, both)
- **And** sync conflicts are detected and reported for manual resolution
- **And** dry-run mode shows what changes would be made without executing
- **And** sync operations can be configured to exclude patterns (.git/, node_modules/, etc.)

**Sync Conflict Resolution:**
- Newer timestamp wins (configurable)
- Manual conflict resolution mode
- Preserve both versions with suffix

## Story 7: Transfer Error Handling and Recovery
As a developer performing file transfers, I want robust error handling so that transfer failures are handled gracefully with recovery options.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** file transfer operations may encounter errors
- **When** transfer errors occur
- **Then** specific error types are identified (permission denied, disk full, network error, etc.)
- **And** partial transfers are detected and can be resumed
- **And** corrupted transfers are detected using checksums
- **And** network interruptions trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **And** file locking conflicts are detected and retried
- **And** insufficient disk space is detected before transfer begins
- **And** transfer logs capture detailed error information for troubleshooting

**Error Recovery Strategies:**
- Network errors: automatic retry up to 3 attempts
- Permission errors: clear error message with suggested fixes
- Disk space errors: cleanup suggestions and retry options
- Corruption detection: automatic re-transfer of affected files

## Story 8: File Transfer Security and Validation
As a security-conscious developer, I want secure file transfer operations so that file integrity is maintained and sensitive information is protected.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** file transfers contain potentially sensitive information
- **When** transfer operations are performed
- **Then** all transfers use encrypted SFTP protocol
- **And** file checksums are calculated and verified for integrity
- **And** temporary files are created with restrictive permissions (600)
- **And** transfer logs do not contain file contents or sensitive paths
- **And** file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **And** large file transfers do not expose sensitive information in memory dumps
- **And** cleanup removes all temporary transfer files

**Security Measures:**
- SFTP encryption mandatory
- SHA-256 checksums for integrity verification
- Secure temporary file handling
- Path validation against directory traversal
- Memory-safe handling of large files
