# Epic: Interactive Terminal Enhancement

## Epic Intent

Transform the existing read-only xterm.js terminal interface into a fully interactive terminal where users can type commands directly in the browser while maintaining seamless integration with Claude Code's MCP command execution. Both user-typed commands and Claude Code commands execute through the same SSH session with proper concurrency management and no command echo duplication.

## Overall Proposed Architecture

### Core Components
- **Browser Terminal (xterm.js)**: Enhanced with local echo, command line editing, and input state management
- **WebSocket Communication**: Bidirectional messaging for command execution and output streaming  
- **MCP Server Command Queue**: Centralized execution management for both user and Claude Code commands
- **SSH Session Manager**: Shared session handling with command source tracking

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Existing xterm.js with enhanced input handling and terminal state management
- **Backend**: Enhanced WebSocket handlers in existing web-server-manager.ts
- **SSH Integration**: Extended ssh-connection-manager.ts with command queuing and source tracking
- **Protocol**: WebSocket messages with command source identification

### High-Level Component Connections
```
User Input → xterm.js → WebSocket → MCP Server → SSH Session
                                      ↓
Claude Code → MCP Tools → MCP Server → SSH Session  
                           ↓
                      Command Queue (FIFO execution)
                           ↓
                      SSH Command Execution
                           ↓
Output → WebSocket → xterm.js (with source-based unlocking)
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Single SSH Session**: User and Claude Code commands share the same SSH session and environment
- **Sequential Execution**: Commands execute in order with proper queuing to prevent output interleaving
- **Source Tracking**: All commands tagged with originator (user vs claude) for proper terminal state management
- **No Command Echo**: Server returns only command output, browser handles command display locally

## User Stories

### Story 1: Browser Terminal Input Handling
**As a** user viewing an SSH session in the browser terminal  
**I want to** type commands directly in the terminal interface  
**So that** I can interact with the remote server without switching tools

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1.1: Local Command Echo**  
**Given** I have an SSH session open in the browser terminal  
**When** I type characters on the keyboard  
**Then** the characters appear immediately in the terminal (local echo)  
**And** the terminal cursor moves with each character typed  
**And** I can use backspace to delete characters locally  

**AC1.2: Command Line Navigation**  
**Given** I am typing a command in the terminal  
**When** I press arrow keys, Home, End, or other navigation keys  
**Then** the cursor moves appropriately within the current command line  
**And** I can edit the command at any position using xterm.js capabilities  

**AC1.3: Command Submission**  
**Given** I have typed a complete command  
**When** I press Enter  
**Then** the terminal moves to a new line and shows a fresh prompt  
**And** the terminal becomes locked for further input  
**And** the complete command is sent to the MCP server via WebSocket  

**AC1.4: Terminal Input Locking**  
**Given** I have sent a command and am waiting for results  
**When** I try to type additional characters  
**Then** the terminal does not accept input (locked state)  
**And** visual indication shows the terminal is processing a command  

**AC1.5: Terminal Input Unlocking**  
**Given** my command has completed and results are displayed  
**When** the server confirms my user command finished  
**Then** the terminal unlocks for new input  
**And** I can type the next command immediately

---

### Story 2: WebSocket Message Enhancement  
**As a** developer integrating browser input with the MCP server  
**I want to** handle user command input through WebSocket messages  
**So that** user commands execute through the same SSH infrastructure as Claude Code

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC2.1: User Command Message Handling**  
**Given** the WebSocket server is running  
**When** it receives a `terminal_input` message from the browser  
**Then** it extracts the complete user command from the message  
**And** it forwards the command to the SSH connection manager for execution  
**And** it marks the command as "user-initiated" for tracking  

**AC2.2: Command Source Identification**  
**Given** commands can come from browser users or Claude Code MCP tools  
**When** any command is processed by the SSH connection manager  
**Then** the command is tagged with its source ("user" or "claude")  
**And** this source information is preserved through execution  
**And** response messages include the command source for client handling  

**AC2.3: WebSocket Response Format**  
**Given** a user command has completed execution  
**When** the MCP server sends results back to the browser  
**Then** the WebSocket message includes command output content  
**And** the message includes source identification ("user-initiated": true)  
**And** the message excludes the original command text (no echo)  

**AC2.4: Session Validation**  
**Given** a user sends a command via WebSocket  
**When** the MCP server processes the terminal input  
**Then** it validates the SSH session exists and is active  
**And** it provides clear error messages if the session is unavailable  
**And** it maintains session state consistency

---

### Story 3: MCP Server Command Queue Management  
**As an** MCP server managing SSH command execution  
**I want to** handle concurrent commands from users and Claude Code  
**So that** commands execute sequentially without output interleaving or conflicts

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC3.1: Command Queuing System**  
**Given** the SSH connection manager receives commands from multiple sources  
**When** a command arrives while another is executing  
**Then** the new command is added to a FIFO queue for that session  
**And** the queue maintains command source information  
**And** commands execute strictly in order received  

**AC3.2: Concurrent Execution Prevention**  
**Given** a command is currently executing on an SSH session  
**When** another command (user or Claude Code) attempts to execute  
**Then** the second command waits in queue  
**And** no simultaneous commands execute on the same SSH session  
**And** proper timing isolation prevents output interleaving  

**AC3.3: Queue State Management**  
**Given** commands are queued for execution  
**When** the current command completes  
**Then** the next command in queue begins execution immediately  
**And** queue state is properly maintained through command lifecycle  
**And** empty queue allows immediate execution of new commands  

**AC3.4: Command Source Preservation**  
**Given** commands from different sources are queued  
**When** each command executes and completes  
**Then** the response maintains the original command source  
**And** user commands trigger terminal unlock messages  
**And** Claude Code commands do not affect terminal lock state  

**AC3.5: Error Handling in Queue**  
**Given** a queued command fails during execution  
**When** the error occurs  
**Then** the error response includes proper source identification  
**And** the queue continues processing remaining commands  
**And** failed commands do not block subsequent command execution

### Story 4: SSH Session Command Execution Enhancement  
**As an** SSH connection manager  
**I want to** execute user commands with the same reliability as MCP commands  
**So that** users experience consistent command execution regardless of input method

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC4.1: Unified Command Execution**  
**Given** a command from any source (user or Claude Code)  
**When** it executes on the SSH session  
**Then** it uses the same underlying SSH shell channel  
**And** it maintains session state and environment variables  
**And** it provides identical output formatting and error handling  

**AC4.2: Command Output Streaming**  
**Given** a user command is executing  
**When** the command produces output  
**Then** output streams back to WebSocket clients in real-time  
**And** output format matches Claude Code command output  
**And** no command echo is included in the output stream  

**AC4.3: Session State Consistency**  
**Given** both user and Claude Code commands modify session state  
**When** commands execute in sequence  
**Then** directory changes, environment variables, and session state persist  
**And** subsequent commands see state changes from previous commands  
**And** session consistency is maintained regardless of command source  

**AC4.4: Command History Integration**  
**Given** user commands execute through the SSH session  
**When** commands complete  
**Then** they are added to the session command history  
**And** history includes both user and Claude Code commands  
**And** command history maintains source identification  

**AC4.5: Terminal Output Compatibility**  
**Given** user commands produce various output types  
**When** output is sent to the browser terminal  
**Then** ANSI escape codes and formatting are preserved  
**And** cursor movement and terminal control sequences work properly  
**And** output is compatible with xterm.js terminal rendering

---

### Story 5: Terminal State Synchronization  
**As a** browser terminal client  
**I want to** synchronize my input state with command execution status  
**So that** I only accept input when the system is ready for new commands

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC5.1: Source-Based Terminal Unlocking**  
**Given** the terminal is locked waiting for a user command result  
**When** the WebSocket receives command output  
**Then** the terminal only unlocks if the output is from a user-initiated command  
**And** Claude Code command output does not unlock the terminal  
**And** terminal remains locked until the specific user command completes  

**AC5.2: Visual State Indicators**  
**Given** commands are executing with the terminal locked  
**When** users view the terminal interface  
**Then** clear visual indication shows the terminal is processing  
**And** different indicators distinguish user vs Claude Code command execution  
**And** terminal state is immediately obvious to users  

**AC5.3: Multiple Client Synchronization**  
**Given** multiple browser clients view the same SSH session  
**When** one client sends a user command  
**Then** all clients show the locked terminal state  
**And** all clients receive the same command output  
**And** all clients unlock simultaneously when the user command completes  

**AC5.4: State Recovery After Disconnect**  
**Given** a browser client disconnects and reconnects  
**When** the client reestablishes WebSocket connection  
**Then** terminal state reflects current command execution status  
**And** locked/unlocked state is properly restored  
**And** command history and output buffer are synchronized  

**AC5.5: Error State Handling**  
**Given** command execution encounters errors  
**When** errors occur during user command execution  
**Then** terminal unlocks to allow recovery commands  
**And** error output is displayed with proper source identification  
**And** users can immediately attempt error recovery
