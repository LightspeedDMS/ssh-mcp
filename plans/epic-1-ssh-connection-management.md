# Epic 1: Core SSH Connection Management

## Epic Intent
Implement persistent SSH connection management that allows Claude Code to establish, maintain, and execute commands on remote servers through named sessions with full terminal capabilities.

## Story 1: SSH Connection Establishment
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to establish named SSH connections to remote servers so that I can maintain persistent sessions for distributed development workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** valid SSH credentials and connection details
- **When** I create a new SSH connection with a unique name
- **Then** the system establishes a persistent SSH connection
- **And** the connection is stored with the provided name identifier
- **And** the connection status is tracked as 'connected'
- **And** connection metadata (host, user, last activity) is maintained

**Performance Requirements:**
- Connection establishment must complete within 10 seconds
- System must support minimum 5 concurrent SSH connections

## Story 2: SSH Command Execution
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to execute bash commands on remote servers through named SSH sessions so that I can run development operations remotely.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an active SSH session exists with a specific name
- **When** I execute a bash command through that session
- **Then** the command is sent to the remote server via SSH
- **And** the command output (stdout/stderr) is captured completely
- **And** the command exit code is returned
- **And** the working directory context is maintained between commands
- **And** environment variables are preserved across command executions
- **And** interactive commands are supported with proper TTY allocation

**Performance Requirements:**
- Command execution must begin within 2 seconds of request
- Output streaming must have latency under 100ms

## Story 3: Connection Health Monitoring
As a developer using Claude Code, I want automatic monitoring of SSH connection health so that I can be notified of connection issues and have reliable session management.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** one or more SSH connections are established
- **When** the system monitors connection health
- **Then** each connection status is updated every 30 seconds
- **And** failed connections are marked with 'error' status
- **And** connection failures include error details and timestamps
- **And** automatic reconnection attempts are made for failed connections
- **And** maximum retry attempts are configurable (default: 3)
- **And** exponential backoff is used between reconnection attempts

## Story 4: Session State Persistence
As a developer using Claude Code, I want SSH sessions to maintain their terminal state so that I can continue work across multiple command executions.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an SSH session is executing commands
- **When** commands modify the terminal environment (cd, export, etc.)
- **Then** subsequent commands inherit the modified environment
- **And** working directory changes persist across commands
- **And** environment variable modifications persist across commands
- **And** command history is maintained per session
- **And** background processes remain active between command executions

## Story 5: Multiple Session Management
As a developer using Claude Code, I want to manage multiple named SSH sessions simultaneously so that I can work with multiple remote servers concurrently.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** multiple SSH sessions are required
- **When** I create sessions with different names
- **Then** each session maintains independent connection state
- **And** each session has isolated working directories
- **And** each session has isolated environment variables
- **And** session names are unique and validated
- **And** I can list all active sessions with their status
- **And** I can disconnect specific sessions by name
- **And** session cleanup occurs when connections are closed

**Performance Requirements:**
- System must handle minimum 5 concurrent sessions
- Session isolation must prevent cross-session interference
