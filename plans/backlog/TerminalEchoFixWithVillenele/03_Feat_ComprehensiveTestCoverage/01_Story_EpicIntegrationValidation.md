  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'sleep 10', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 2000},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'sleep 10', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 2000},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "after"'}
]
```
- **Then** pre-cancellation commands should show corrected echo display
- **And** cancelled commands should show appropriate interruption without echo duplication

```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "browser cmd"'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'}  // Should be gated
]
```
