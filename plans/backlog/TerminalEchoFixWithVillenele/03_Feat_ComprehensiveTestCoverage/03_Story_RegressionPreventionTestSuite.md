# Story 03: Regression Prevention Test Suite

## User Story

**As a** SSH MCP server development team  
**I want** a comprehensive permanent test suite that prevents any future regression of echo fixes or Command State Synchronization functionality  
**So that** ongoing development can proceed with confidence that terminal display quality and advanced features are protected from accidental breakage

## Acceptance Criteria

### Comprehensive Echo Regression Detection

**AC 3.1**: Echo duplication detection test suite
- **Given** permanent test suite for echo regression prevention
- **When** tests are executed to detect any echo duplication
- **Then** test suite should detect any instance of command appearing twice in terminal output
- **And** should test all command types: basic, complex, file operations, system commands
- **And** should validate echo behavior across browser and MCP command execution
- **And** should provide clear failure messages identifying specific echo duplication instances

**AC 3.2**: Cross-command-type echo validation
- **Given** comprehensive echo regression test coverage
- **When** validating echo behavior across all command categories
- **Then** test suite should cover:
```typescript
echoRegressionTests: {
  basicCommands: ['pwd', 'whoami', 'date', 'hostname'],
  fileOperations: ['ls', 'ls -la', 'cat filename', 'find pattern'],
  textProcessing: ['grep pattern', 'wc -l', 'head -5', 'tail -10'],
  systemCommands: ['ps aux', 'df -h', 'free -m', 'uptime'],
  complexCommands: ['ps aux | grep ssh', 'find / -name "*.log" | head -5']
}
```
- **And** each command type should be validated for single display occurrence
- **And** tests should run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- **And** any echo regression should cause immediate build failure

**AC 3.3**: Protocol-specific echo regression detection
- **Given** browser and MCP command execution paths
- **When** testing echo behavior across different command initiators
- **Then** test suite should validate:
  - Browser commands display exactly once via WebSocket terminal_input
  - MCP commands display exactly once via JSON-RPC stdin
  - Mixed protocol sequences maintain correct echo display
  - Protocol transitions don't introduce echo artifacts
- **And** should detect regressions specific to each protocol independently
- **And** should validate that echo fix remains effective for browser commands only

### Command State Synchronization Regression Prevention

gatingRegressionTest: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "test"'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'}  // Should be gated
]
```
- **And** MCP command should be blocked with BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED error

- **And** should detect any failure in gating logic or error reporting

**AC 3.6**: Command cancellation regression detection

  - Browser commands route correctly via WebSocket terminal_input
  - MCP commands route correctly via JSON-RPC stdin
  - Sequential execution maintains proper command ordering
  - Response synchronization works across both protocols
- **And** should detect any failure in dual-channel routing logic
- **And** should ensure protocol-specific execution remains accurate

**AC 3.9**: Dynamic expected value construction regression detection
- **Given** dynamic expected value construction with environment variables
- **When** testing cross-environment test execution capability
- **Then** test suite should validate:
  - Environment variable resolution: `${process.env.USER}`, `${process.env.PWD}`
  - Template expansion and substitution accuracy
  - Cross-platform compatibility maintenance
  - Runtime value caching and performance optimization
- **And** should detect any failure in dynamic value construction
