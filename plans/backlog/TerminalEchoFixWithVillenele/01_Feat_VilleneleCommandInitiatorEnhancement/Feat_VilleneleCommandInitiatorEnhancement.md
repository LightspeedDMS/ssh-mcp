# Feature 01: Villenele Command Initiator Enhancement

## Feature Description and Objectives

**Feature Intent**: Transform the Villenele testing framework to support dual-channel command execution with browser command emulation, timeout-based cancellation, and complete test suite migration to enhanced parameter structure.

**Core Problem Solved**: Current Villenele framework cannot test browser-initiated commands, leaving critical testing gaps for terminal interaction scenarios and preventing comprehensive validation of Command State Synchronization Epic functionality.

**Business Value**: Enables comprehensive testing of browser terminal behavior, command state conflicts, and echo display issues while providing robust infrastructure for future terminal feature development.

## Technical Architecture Specific to Feature

### Enhanced PostWebSocketCommandExecutor Design
```
PostWebSocketCommandExecutor (Enhanced)
├── Command Router
│   ├── Browser Channel → WebSocket terminal_input messages  
│   └── MCP Channel → JSON-RPC stdin (existing)
├── Sequential Execution Engine
│   ├── Response Waiting → Protocol-specific completion detection
│   ├── Timeout Management → Configurable command timeouts
│   └── Error Handling → Graceful failure with continuation options
└── Cancellation Framework
    ├── Browser Cancellation → sendTerminalSignal(SIGINT) 
    ├── MCP Cancellation → ssh_cancel_command tool
    └── Timeout-based Interruption → Automatic cancellation after wait period
```

### Universal Command Structure
```typescript
// New enhanced parameter structure for all Villenele tests
Array<{
  initiator: 'browser' | 'mcp-client';
  command: string;
  cancel?: boolean;           // Trigger cancellation after timeout
  waitToCancelMs?: number;    // Cancellation timeout (default: 10000ms)
}>
```

### Integration Strategy with Existing Framework
- **Preserve**: All existing 9-story Villenele architecture (Stories 1-9)
- **Extend**: PostWebSocketCommandExecutor with dual-channel capability
- **Migrate**: ALL existing test files to enhanced parameter structure
- **Maintain**: Backward compatibility during migration process only

## Dependencies on Other Features

**Dependencies**: None - this is the foundational feature that enables subsequent features

**Enables**: 
- Feature 02 (Terminal Echo Fix) requires enhanced Villenele for comprehensive validation
- Feature 03 (Test Coverage) requires browser command emulation capability

**Integration Points**:
- Must preserve Command State Synchronization Epic functionality
- Must work with existing SSH Connection Manager infrastructure  
- Must integrate with WebSocket terminal_input message handling

## Story Implementation Order

- [x] **01_Story_EnhancedParameterStructureRefactor**: Implement new command structure with validation and backward compatibility
- [x] **02_Story_BrowserCommandEmulation**: Add WebSocket terminal_input message routing for browser command execution
- [x] **03_Story_SequentialCommandExecution**: Ensure proper response waiting and command ordering across dual channels
- [x] **04_Story_CompleteTestSuiteMigration**: Universal migration of ALL existing tests to enhanced parameter structure  
- [x] **05_Story_CommandInterruptionEmulation**: Implement timeout-based cancellation for both browser and MCP commands
- [x] **06_Story_DynamicExpectedValueConstruction**: Build runtime expected value generation for cross-environment compatibility

## Quality Requirements

### Quality Gates
- **Zero Test Regressions**: All existing Villenele tests must pass after enhancement
- **Universal Migration**: 100% conversion of existing test suite to new parameter structure
- **Channel Isolation**: Browser and MCP commands must execute independently without interference
- **Cancellation Reliability**: Timeout-based cancellation must work consistently within specified wait periods

## Testing Infrastructure Requirements

### Real Infrastructure Testing (CLAUDE.md Compliance)
- **No Mocks**: All tests use real SSH connections via ssh2 library
- **Authentic Protocols**: Real WebSocket terminal_input messages and JSON-RPC MCP communication
- **Environment Independence**: Tests work across different user accounts and directory structures

### Comprehensive Test Scenarios
- **Mixed Command Sequences**: Interleaved browser and MCP commands with proper ordering
- **Cancellation Testing**: Both immediate completion and timeout-based interruption scenarios  
- **Error Handling**: Network failures, timeout exceeded, and protocol error recovery
- **Edge Cases**: Empty commands, invalid initiators, missing required parameters

This feature provides the essential testing infrastructure foundation that enables comprehensive validation of terminal behavior and supports the subsequent echo fix implementation with confidence.
