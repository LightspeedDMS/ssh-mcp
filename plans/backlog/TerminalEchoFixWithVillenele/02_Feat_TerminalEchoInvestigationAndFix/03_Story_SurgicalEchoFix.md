# Story 03: Surgical Echo Fix

## User Story

**As a** SSH MCP server maintainer  
**I want** minimal, surgical code changes to eliminate double echo in browser terminal display  
**So that** I can restore professional terminal appearance while preserving all Command State Synchronization Epic functionality without architectural disruption

## Acceptance Criteria

### Echo Fix Implementation Requirements

**AC 3.1**: Minimal code change implementation
- **Given** root cause analysis from Story 1 identifying exact duplication source
- **When** implementing echo fix
- **Then** changes should be confined to minimum necessary code modifications
- **And** fix should target only the specific lines/functions causing duplication
- **And** no architectural changes or major refactoring should be required
- **And** total lines of code changed should be < 20 lines across all files

**AC 3.2**: Browser command echo elimination
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** browser commands are executed via WebSocket terminal_input messages
- **Then** commands should display exactly once in browser terminal: `[${process.env.USER}@localhost ${process.env.PWD}]$ pwd`
- **And** command results should display exactly once: `${process.env.PWD}`
- **And** no duplication should occur in command echo or command results
- **And** terminal display should match native Linux terminal behavior exactly

**AC 3.3**: MCP command echo preservation
- **Given** echo fix implementation affecting browser command handling
- **When** MCP commands are executed via JSON-RPC stdin
- **Then** MCP command display should remain unchanged and correct
- **And** MCP commands should display exactly once without duplication
- **And** MCP command behavior should be identical to pre-fix behavior
- **And** no regression should be introduced in MCP command echo handling

### Command State Synchronization Preservation

**AC 3.4**: Browser command tracking preservation during fix
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** browser commands are executed and tracked
- **Then** Command State Synchronization browser command buffer should work identically
- **And** browser commands should be tracked with correct source attribution: 'user'
- **And** command buffer should contain exact command strings and results
- **And** tracking functionality should be completely unaffected by echo changes

**AC 3.5**: MCP command gating preservation during fix
- **Given** echo fix implementation and browser commands in buffer
- **When** MCP commands are attempted with browser commands present
- **Then** MCP gating should work identically to pre-fix behavior
- **And** BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED error should include complete browser command results
- **And** error format should remain exactly the same as current implementation
- **And** gating logic should be completely unaffected by echo fix

**AC 3.6**: Command cancellation preservation during fix
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** command cancellation is triggered for browser and MCP commands
- **Then** browser command cancellation via WebSocket SIGINT should work identically
- **And** MCP command cancellation via ssh_cancel_command should work identically
- **And** cancellation timing and behavior should remain unchanged
- **And** cancelled command recording should work correctly with fixed echo display

### Fix Validation Using Enhanced Villenele

**AC 3.7**: Single browser command echo validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes single browser command test:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [{initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'}]
```
- **Then** concatenatedResponses should contain command echo exactly once: `pwd`
- **And** concatenatedResponses should contain command result exactly once: `${process.env.PWD}`
- **And** no duplication should appear in captured WebSocket responses
- **And** terminal display should show clean, professional output

**AC 3.8**: Multiple browser commands echo validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes browser command sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'whoami'}, 
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "test"'}
]
```
- **Then** each command should display exactly once without duplication
- **And** command sequence should show clean terminal progression
- **And** no echo artifacts should appear between commands
- **And** terminal display should maintain professional appearance throughout

**AC 3.9**: Mixed command scenario echo validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes mixed browser and MCP commands:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'date'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'echo "mcp test"'}
]
```
- **Then** all commands should display correctly without duplication
- **And** browser commands should show fixed echo behavior
- **And** MCP commands should show unchanged echo behavior
- **And** command transitions should be clean without echo artifacts

### Regression Prevention and Validation

**AC 3.10**: Comprehensive echo regression testing
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** executing comprehensive test suite covering all command scenarios
- **Then** all test scenarios should pass with corrected echo behavior
- **And** no new echo issues should be introduced in any command type
- **And** edge cases (long commands, special characters, CRLF handling) should work correctly
- **And** terminal formatting should remain consistent across all scenarios

**AC 3.11**: WebSocket message format preservation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** WebSocket messages are transmitted for browser terminal display
- **Then** WebSocket message format should remain unchanged from current format
- **And** CRLF line endings should be preserved for xterm.js compatibility
- **And** message timing and structure should be identical to pre-fix behavior
- **And** browser terminal WebSocket integration should work without changes

**AC 3.12**: SSH connection behavior preservation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** SSH connections are established and managed
- **Then** SSH connection management should work identically to current implementation
- **And** SSH command execution should remain unchanged
- **And** SSH response capture should work correctly with fixed echo display
- **And** SSH session state should be maintained properly throughout

### Stability Validation

**AC 3.13**: Stability and error handling validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** error conditions occur (network failures, SSH issues, WebSocket problems)
- **Then** error handling should work identically to pre-fix behavior
- **And** error recovery should maintain correct echo display behavior
- **And** system stability should be unaffected by echo fix changes
- **And** no new error conditions should be introduced

**AC 3.14**: Long-term stability validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** system runs over extended periods with multiple command executions
- **Then** echo fix should remain stable without degradation
- **And** no echo reversion should occur over time
- **And** memory leaks or performance degradation should not develop
- **And** fix should prove robust under sustained operation

### Fix Documentation and Maintenance

**AC 3.15**: Fix implementation documentation
- **Given** completed echo fix implementation
- **When** documenting changes for future maintenance
- **Then** should document exact changes made with clear explanations
- **And** should explain why fix eliminates duplication without affecting other functionality
- **And** should include before/after examples showing fix effectiveness
- **And** should provide maintenance guidance for preserving fix in future changes

**AC 3.16**: Fix validation test preservation
- **Given** echo fix validation tests created during implementation
- **When** integrating tests into permanent test suite
- **Then** validation tests should be preserved to prevent future regressions
- **And** tests should be integrated into CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation
- **And** test documentation should explain echo fix validation purpose
- **And** tests should provide early warning for any future echo issues

**AC 3.17**: Fix rollback capability
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** rollback becomes necessary for unforeseen issues
- **Then** changes should be easily reversible to pre-fix state
- **And** rollback should be possible without affecting Command State Synchronization

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Surgical Fix Strategy
- **Targeted Changes**: Focus only on code causing duplication, leave everything else unchanged
- **Minimal Impact**: Preserve existing logic flow and error handling paths
- **Isolation**: Ensure fix affects only browser command echo, not MCP commands
- **Validation**: Use enhanced Villenele to validate fix before and after implementation

### Expected Fix Areas
- **WebSocket Response Processing**: Likely source of duplication in browser command handling
- **Command Echo Logic**: Specific regex or string processing causing duplicate display
- **Response Formatting**: CRLF handling or message construction causing duplication
- **Buffer Integration**: Interaction between Command State Sync buffer and echo display

### Implementation Approach
- **Analysis-Driven**: Use Story 1 analysis results to target exact fix location
- **Test-Driven**: Implement fix with continuous validation using enhanced Villenele
- **Incremental**: Make smallest possible change, test, refine as needed
- **Preservation-First**: Ensure Command State Sync functionality unchanged at each step

This story delivers the precise echo fix while maintaining complete system functionality and providing comprehensive validation of the solution.
