# Story 01: Echo Regression Analysis

## User Story

**As a** SSH MCP server maintainer  
**I want** comprehensive analysis of the double echo regression using enhanced Villenele testing infrastructure  
**So that** I can identify the exact source of command duplication and understand the interaction between echo handling and Command State Synchronization functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

### Baseline Echo Behavior Analysis

**AC 1.1**: Pre-Command State Sync echo behavior documentation
- **Given** access to git commit history before Command State Synchronization Epic implementation
- **When** analyzing baseline terminal echo behavior
- **Then** should document exact echo behavior before regression: single command display
- **And** capture specific examples of correct echo format: `[${process.env.USER}@localhost ${process.env.PWD}]$ command` followed by result
- **And** establish baseline for both browser-initiated and MCP-initiated commands
- **And** confirm baseline shows no command duplication in terminal display

**AC 1.2**: Current regression behavior characterization
- **Given** current system with double echo regression
- **When** executing browser commands via WebSocket terminal_input messages
- **Then** should capture exact duplication pattern: command appears twice in terminal display
- **And** document specific examples: `pwd\r\npwd\r\n/current/directory` showing duplication
- **And** identify whether duplication affects command echo, results, or both
- **And** determine if regression affects MCP commands or only browser commands

**AC 1.3**: Regression scope and impact analysis
- **Given** comprehensive testing using enhanced Villenele framework
- **When** analyzing different command scenarios for echo behavior
- **Then** should validate regression impact across command types:
  - Simple commands: `pwd`, `whoami`, `date`
  - Complex commands: `ls -la`, `grep pattern file`
  - Interactive commands: commands requiring user input
- **And** determine if regression varies by command complexity or type
- **And** assess whether Command State Synchronization gating affects echo behavior

### Source Code Analysis and Change Detection

**AC 1.4**: Command State Sync implementation impact analysis
- **Given** git diff between pre-Command State Sync and current implementation
- **When** analyzing changes in SSH connection management and echo handling
- **Then** should identify specific code changes that could affect terminal echo:
  - Changes in `ssh-connection-manager.ts` related to command processing
  - Modifications to WebSocket message handling for terminal_input
  - Updates to response formatting and CRLF handling
- **And** correlate code changes with observed echo regression timing
- **And** identify potential interaction points between new features and echo logic

**AC 1.5**: Echo handling logic examination
- **Given** current `ssh-connection-manager.ts` implementation
- **When** analyzing command execution and response formatting logic
- **Then** should trace complete command processing flow:
  - WebSocket terminal_input message reception
  - Command execution via SSH connection
  - Response capture and formatting
  - WebSocket response transmission back to browser
- **And** identify potential duplicate processing points in the flow
- **And** examine regex patterns and string processing that might cause duplication

**AC 1.6**: Browser command buffer interaction analysis
- **Given** Command State Synchronization browser command tracking
- **When** analyzing how browser command buffering affects echo handling
- **Then** should examine interaction between:
  - Browser command buffer management
  - Command echo processing and display
  - Response formatting for WebSocket transmission
- **And** determine if command buffering causes additional echo processing
- **And** validate whether buffer state affects echo display behavior

### Enhanced Villenele Testing for Echo Analysis

**AC 1.7**: Browser command echo pattern analysis using Villenele
- **Given** enhanced Villenele framework with browser command emulation
- **When** executing test sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'whoami'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "test browser command"'}
]
```
- **Then** should capture exact WebSocket response pattern for each command
- **And** identify duplication points: where in response stream commands appear twice
- **And** measure timing between duplicate command appearances
- **And** validate whether all browser commands show duplication or only specific types

**AC 1.8**: MCP command echo pattern validation using Villenele
- **Given** enhanced Villenele framework with MCP command execution
- **When** executing test sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'echo "test mcp command"'}
]
```
- **Then** should validate that MCP commands display correctly without duplication
- **And** confirm MCP command echo behavior matches expected single display
- **And** establish that regression is specific to browser commands, not MCP commands

**AC 1.9**: Mixed command scenario echo analysis using Villenele
- **Given** enhanced Villenele framework with mixed command execution
- **When** executing interleaved browser and MCP commands:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'}, 
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "browser"'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'echo "mcp"'}
]
```
- **Then** should validate echo behavior consistency across command type switches
- **And** identify if command type transitions affect echo duplication
- **And** confirm that mixed scenarios don't introduce additional echo issues

### Command State Synchronization Impact Assessment

**AC 1.10**: Command gating scenario echo behavior analysis
- **Given** Command State Synchronization functionality with browser commands in buffer
- **When** MCP commands are gated due to browser command presence
- **Then** should validate that gating doesn't affect echo behavior of browser commands
- **And** confirm that gated MCP commands display error correctly without echo duplication
- **And** verify that BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED error includes correct command echo format

**AC 1.11**: Command cancellation impact on echo behavior
- **Given** Command State Synchronization cancellation features
- **When** commands are cancelled (both browser and MCP)
- **Then** should validate that cancellation doesn't introduce additional echo issues
- **And** confirm cancelled command echo appears once, not duplicated
- **And** verify that post-cancellation commands display correctly without echo artifacts

**AC 1.12**: Nuclear fallback echo behavior validation
- **Given** Command State Synchronization nuclear fallback capability
- **When** nuclear fallback is triggered to reset session state
- **Then** should validate that fallback doesn't affect subsequent echo behavior
- **And** confirm that post-fallback commands display correctly
- **And** verify that fallback process itself doesn't introduce echo duplication

### Root Cause Hypothesis Formation

**AC 1.13**: Echo duplication mechanism hypothesis development
- **Given** comprehensive analysis results from ACs 1.1-1.12
- **When** synthesizing findings into root cause hypothesis
- **Then** should develop specific hypothesis about duplication mechanism:
  - Identify exact code path causing duplication
  - Explain why browser commands are affected but not MCP commands
  - Describe interaction between Command State Sync and echo handling
- **And** provide evidence supporting the hypothesis from testing results
- **And** predict which code changes would eliminate the duplication

**AC 1.14**: Fix complexity assessment and risk analysis
- **Given** root cause hypothesis and code analysis
- **When** assessing fix implementation complexity
- **Then** should evaluate fix complexity: minimal surgical changes vs major refactoring
- **And** assess risk of fix affecting Command State Synchronization functionality
- **And** identify specific test scenarios needed to validate fix effectiveness
- **And** predict potential side effects or unintended consequences of proposed fix

**AC 1.15**: Analysis documentation and validation
- **Given** complete echo regression analysis results
- **When** documenting findings for fix implementation
- **Then** should provide comprehensive analysis report including:
  - Clear before/after behavior documentation
  - Specific root cause identification with code references
  - Detailed hypothesis with supporting evidence from enhanced Villenele testing
  - Fix approach recommendation with complexity and risk assessment
- **And** validate analysis findings with additional targeted testing
- **And** confirm analysis provides sufficient information for surgical fix implementation
