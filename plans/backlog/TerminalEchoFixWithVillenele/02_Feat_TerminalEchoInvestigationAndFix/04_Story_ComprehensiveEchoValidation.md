# Story 04: Comprehensive Echo Validation

## User Story

**As a** SSH MCP server maintainer  
**I want** extensive validation of echo fix effectiveness using enhanced Villenele testing infrastructure  
**So that** I can confirm complete elimination of double echo across all command scenarios and ensure long-term stability of the terminal display fix

## Acceptance Criteria

### Comprehensive Echo Fix Validation

**AC 4.1**: All command types echo validation
- **Given** completed echo fix implementation
- **When** enhanced Villenele tests all command categories:
  - Basic commands: `pwd`, `whoami`, `date`, `hostname`
  - File operations: `ls`, `ls -la`, `cat filename`, `touch newfile`
  - Text processing: `echo "text"`, `grep pattern`, `wc -l`
  - System commands: `ps aux`, `df -h`, `free -m`, `uptime`
- **Then** every command type should display exactly once without duplication
- **And** no command category should show echo regression
- **And** terminal display should be professional for all command types

**AC 4.2**: Command complexity echo validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** testing commands of varying complexity:
  - Short commands: `pwd`
  - Medium commands: `ls -la src/`
  - Long commands: `find . -name "*.ts" -exec wc -l {} \; | head -10`
  - Complex commands: `ps aux | grep ssh | wc -l`
- **Then** command length should not affect echo fix effectiveness
- **And** complex command pipelines should display correctly without duplication
- **And** all commands should show single echo regardless of complexity

**AC 4.3**: Special character and formatting echo validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation  
- **When** testing commands with special characters and formatting:
  - Quotes: `echo "test with spaces"`, `echo 'single quotes'`
  - Symbols: `echo "test@#$%^&*()"`, `ls -la *.txt`
  - Paths: `ls "./src/ssh connection manager.ts"`, `ls src/*.ts`
  - Unicode: `echo "测试 unicode ñ áéíóú"`
- **Then** all special characters should display correctly without duplication
- **And** command formatting should be preserved in single display
- **And** no character escaping issues should cause echo problems

### Cross-Protocol Echo Validation

**AC 4.4**: Browser-only command sequences validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes extended browser command sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'whoami'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'date'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'hostname'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "browser sequence test"'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'ls'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'ps aux | grep ssh | head -3'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'df -h'}
]
```
- **Then** all browser commands should display exactly once throughout sequence
- **And** no echo degradation should occur as sequence progresses
- **And** terminal display should remain clean and professional throughout

**AC 4.5**: MCP-only command sequences validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation (should not affect MCP commands)
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes extended MCP command sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'date'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'echo "mcp sequence test"'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'ls'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'uptime'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'free -m'}
]
```
- **Then** all MCP commands should display correctly (unchanged from pre-fix)
- **And** MCP command echo behavior should be identical to baseline
- **And** no regression should be introduced in MCP command display

**AC 4.6**: Interleaved browser-MCP command sequences validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes complex interleaved sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "browser1"'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'echo "mcp1"'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'date'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'hostname'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'uptime'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'ls'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'ps aux | head -5'}
]
```
- **Then** browser commands should display with fixed echo behavior
- **And** MCP commands should display with unchanged behavior
- **And** command protocol transitions should not affect echo display
- **And** entire sequence should show consistent, professional terminal output

### Edge Case and Stress Testing

**AC 4.7**: Rapid command execution echo validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes rapid browser command sequence with minimal delays
- **Then** echo fix should remain effective under rapid execution
- **And** no echo duplication should occur due to timing issues
- **And** WebSocket message processing should handle rapid commands correctly
- **And** terminal display should remain clean despite execution speed

**AC 4.8**: Long-running command echo validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation and cancellation capabilities
- **When** testing long-running browser commands:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'sleep 3 && echo "completed"'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'find . -name "*.ts" | head -20'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'ping -c 3 localhost'}
]
```
- **Then** long-running commands should display correctly without duplication
- **And** command output should appear progressively without echo issues
- **And** command completion should show single echo behavior

**AC 4.9**: Interactive command scenario validation
- **Given** echo fix implementation
- **When** testing commands that might expect user input (with appropriate timeouts):
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "non-interactive test"'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'yes | head -3'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "after interactive"'}
]
```
- **Then** all commands should display with correct echo behavior
- **And** interactive command handling should not affect echo fix
- **And** command sequence should continue normally after interactive commands

### Command State Synchronization Integration Testing

**AC 4.10**: Echo validation with command gating scenarios
- **Given** echo fix implementation and Command State Synchronization functionality
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes gating scenario:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},              // Should be tracked
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "browser1"'},  // Should be tracked
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'}        // Should be gated
]
```
- **Then** browser commands should display correctly with fixed echo
- **And** browser commands should be tracked in Command State buffer with correct display
- **And** MCP gating error should include browser commands with correct (non-duplicated) results
- **And** BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED error should show clean browser command output

**AC 4.11**: Echo validation with command cancellation scenarios
- **Given** echo fix implementation and cancellation capabilities
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes cancellation scenario:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "before cancel"'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'sleep 10', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 2000},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "after cancel"'}
]
```
- **Then** pre-cancellation command should display correctly without duplication
- **And** cancelled command should show appropriate interruption display (^C) without echo duplication
- **And** post-cancellation command should display correctly without echo artifacts
- **And** cancellation sequence should maintain professional terminal appearance

**AC 4.12**: Echo validation with nuclear fallback scenarios
- **Given** echo fix implementation and nuclear fallback capability
- **When** nuclear fallback is triggered and subsequent commands executed
- **Then** post-fallback browser commands should display correctly with fixed echo
- **And** fallback should not affect echo fix effectiveness
- **And** session recovery should maintain correct echo behavior
- **And** all subsequent commands should show professional terminal display

### Performance and Stability Validation
