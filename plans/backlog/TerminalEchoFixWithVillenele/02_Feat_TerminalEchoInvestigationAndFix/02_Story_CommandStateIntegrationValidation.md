# Story 02: Command State Integration Validation

## User Story

**As a** SSH MCP server maintainer  
**I want** comprehensive validation that Command State Synchronization Epic functionality remains completely intact during echo investigation  
**So that** I can ensure that echo fix implementation preserves all advanced command tracking, gating, cancellation, and nuclear fallback capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

### Browser Command Tracking Functionality Validation

**AC 2.1**: Browser command buffer tracking validation
- **Given** enhanced Villenele framework with browser command emulation
- **When** executing browser command sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'ls'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'whoami'}
]
```
- **Then** Command State Synchronization should track all browser commands in buffer correctly
- **And** browser command buffer should contain exact commands: `['pwd', 'ls', 'whoami']`
- **And** command source attribution should be marked as 'user' for all browser commands
- **And** buffer state should be accessible for subsequent MCP command gating

**AC 2.2**: Browser command execution completion tracking
- **Given** browser commands executed via enhanced Villenele
- **When** browser commands complete execution
- **Then** Command State Synchronization should mark commands as completed
- **And** completed browser commands should remain in buffer for MCP gating
- **And** buffer should include complete command results for error reporting
- **And** command completion state should be accurately tracked

**AC 2.3**: Browser command buffer persistence across sessions
- **Given** browser commands executed and tracked in buffer
- **When** subsequent operations access the SSH session
- **Then** browser command buffer should persist throughout session lifetime
- **And** buffer contents should remain accessible for command state queries
- **And** buffer should maintain chronological order of browser command execution
- **And** session state should include complete browser command history

### MCP Command Gating Functionality Validation

**AC 2.4**: MCP command gating with browser commands in buffer
- **Given** browser commands in buffer and MCP command execution attempt
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'}  // Should be gated
]
```
- **Then** MCP command should be blocked by Command State Synchronization
- **And** should receive BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED error with complete browser command results
- **And** error should include exact browser command outputs: pwd result
- **And** MCP command should not execute until browser commands are cleared

**AC 2.5**: BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED error format validation
- **Given** MCP command gating scenario with browser commands in buffer
- **When** gated MCP command receives error response
- **Then** error should follow exact format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED", 
    "message": "Browser commands have been executed. Results:",
    "data": {
      "browserCommands": ["pwd"],
      "results": ["${process.env.PWD}"]
    }
  }
}
```
- **And** browserCommands array should contain all executed browser commands
- **And** results array should contain corresponding command outputs
- **And** error structure should be consistent and parseable

**AC 2.6**: Multiple browser commands gating validation
- **Given** multiple browser commands in buffer
- **When** MCP command is attempted after browser command sequence:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "test"'},
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'whoami'},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'date'}  // Should be gated
]
```
- **Then** BROWSER_COMMANDS_EXECUTED error should include all browser command results
- **And** error data should contain complete command history and outputs
- **And** gating should work correctly regardless of browser command count

### Command Cancellation Functionality Validation

**AC 2.7**: Browser command cancellation capability validation
- **Given** enhanced Villenele with cancellation support from Feature 1
- **When** browser command with cancellation is executed:
```typescript
{initiator: 'browser', command: 'sleep 10', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 2000}
```
- **Then** Command State Synchronization should cancel browser command via WebSocket SIGINT
- **And** cancelled command should be recorded in browser command buffer
- **And** cancellation should work identically to pre-echo-investigation behavior
- **And** session state should remain stable after browser command cancellation

**AC 2.8**: MCP command cancellation capability validation
- **Given** enhanced Villenele with MCP command cancellation
- **When** MCP command with cancellation is executed:
```typescript
{initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'sleep 15', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 3000}
```
- **Then** Command State Synchronization should cancel MCP command via ssh_cancel_command
- **And** cancellation should work through existing MCP tool infrastructure
- **And** cancelled MCP command should complete without affecting browser command buffer
- **And** MCP cancellation should function identically to current implementation

**AC 2.9**: Mixed cancellation scenario validation
- **Given** sequence with both browser and MCP command cancellations
- **When** enhanced Villenele executes mixed cancellation scenario:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'sleep 10', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 2000},
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'sleep 10', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 2000}
]
```
- **Then** browser command should be cancelled via WebSocket SIGINT
- **And** MCP command should be cancelled via ssh_cancel_command
- **And** both cancellation mechanisms should work independently without interference
- **And** Command State Synchronization should handle mixed cancellations correctly

### Nuclear Fallback Functionality Validation

**AC 2.10**: Nuclear fallback capability preservation
- **Given** Command State Synchronization nuclear fallback implementation
- **When** nuclear fallback is triggered to reset session state
- **Then** nuclear fallback should clear browser command buffer completely
- **And** fallback should reset all command state tracking to clean state
- **And** post-fallback session should accept both browser and MCP commands normally
- **And** fallback mechanism should work identically to current implementation

**AC 2.11**: Nuclear fallback trigger conditions validation
- **Given** nuclear fallback trigger scenarios
- **When** conditions requiring fallback occur (session stuck, unrecoverable state)
- **Then** fallback detection should work correctly
- **And** fallback should be triggered automatically when appropriate
- **And** fallback should provide clean recovery path for stuck sessions
- **And** trigger logic should remain unchanged from current implementation

**AC 2.12**: Post-nuclear-fallback functionality validation  
- **Given** session state after nuclear fallback execution
- **When** subsequent commands are executed after fallback
- **Then** browser commands should execute normally and be tracked in new buffer
- **And** MCP commands should execute without gating issues
- **And** all Command State Synchronization features should work correctly post-fallback
- **And** no residual state should interfere with normal operation

### Integration Stress Testing

**AC 2.13**: Complex command state synchronization scenario validation
- **Given** enhanced Villenele framework with complex command scenarios
- **When** executing comprehensive integration scenario:
```typescript
postWebSocketCommands: [
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'pwd'},                    // Tracked in buffer
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'echo "browser1"'},        // Tracked in buffer  
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'whoami'},             // Should be gated
  // Nuclear fallback triggered here
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'date'},                   // New buffer after fallback
  {initiator: 'mcp-client', command: 'echo "mcp works"'},   // Should execute normally
  {initiator: 'browser', command: 'sleep 5', cancel: true, waitToCancelMs: 2000} // Cancellation test
]
```
- **Then** all Command State Synchronization features should work correctly throughout
- **And** command gating, tracking, cancellation, and fallback should function as expected
- **And** complex scenario should demonstrate complete functionality preservation

**AC 2.14**: Command state synchronization performance validation
- **Given** Command State Synchronization functionality during echo investigation
- **When** measuring performance of command tracking and gating
- **Then** performance should remain identical to pre-echo-investigation measurements
- **And** browser command tracking should not introduce performance degradation
- **And** MCP command gating should execute within expected time bounds
- **And** memory usage should remain consistent with current implementation

**AC 2.15**: Command state synchronization error handling validation
- **Given** Command State Synchronization error scenarios
- **When** error conditions occur (network failures, SSH disconnections, etc.)
- **Then** error handling should work identically to current implementation
- **And** error recovery should maintain command state consistency
- **And** error reporting should include correct command state information
- **And** no new error conditions should be introduced during echo investigation
