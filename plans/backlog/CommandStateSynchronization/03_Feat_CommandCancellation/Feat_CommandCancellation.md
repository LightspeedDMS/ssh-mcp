# Feature: Command Cancellation

## Feature Description

Source-specific command cancellation system allowing browser users (Ctrl-C) and MCP clients (cancel command) to terminate their respective commands without affecting the other source.

## Technical Architecture

### Cancellation Sources
- **Browser**: Existing Ctrl-C via `sendTerminalSignal`
- **MCP Client**: New `ssh_cancel_command` tool

### Gating Integration
- Cancellation respects command source ownership
- Browser can only cancel browser-initiated commands
- MCP can only cancel MCP-initiated commands
