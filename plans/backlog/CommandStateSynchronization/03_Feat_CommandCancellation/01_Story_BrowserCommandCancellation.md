# Story: Browser Command Cancellation

## User Story
As a browser terminal user, I want to use Ctrl-C to cancel my running commands so that I can stop unresponsive or unwanted commands without affecting MCP client operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given: Browser-initiated command is running
### When: User presses Ctrl-C in browser terminal
### Then: Only browser command is cancelled, gatekeeper releases lock for MCP

**Scenario 1: Browser command cancellation releases gatekeeper**
- Given browser has initiated a long-running command (e.g., `sleep 30`)
- When user presses Ctrl-C
- Then command is terminated via existing `sendTerminalSignal` mechanism
- And gatekeeper lock is released
- And MCP commands can immediately proceed

**Scenario 2: Ctrl-C signal properly routes to browser commands only**
- Given browser command is running via WebSocket
- When Ctrl-C signal sent through `sendTerminalSignal`
- Then signal reaches only the browser-initiated command
- And other command sources remain unaffected

**Scenario 3: Cancellation preserves command history tracking**
- Given browser command is executing and tracked in browserCommandBuffer
- When command is cancelled via Ctrl-C
- Then cancelled command remains in browserCommandBuffer for MCP awareness
- And command status updated to reflect cancellation

## Technical Implementation

### Browser Integration Points
- ‚úÖ Existing `sendTerminalSignal` mechanism continues working unchanged
- üìä Enhanced cancellation to release gatekeeper lock
- üîß Command source tracking for proper signal routing

### Gatekeeper Release Logic
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Browser command cancellation triggers `releaseLock()` 
- ‚öôÔ∏è Lock release enables immediate MCP command execution
- üîç Timeout cleanup prevents orphaned locks

## Testing Requirements

### E2E Test Scenarios
- Long-running browser command + Ctrl-C cancellation
- Immediate MCP command execution after cancellation
- Multiple cancellation attempts handling
- Proper signal routing verification

### Unit Test Coverage
- Gatekeeper lock/release mechanisms
- Command source identification
- Signal routing logic
- Buffer state after cancellation

## Definition of Done
- ‚úÖ Browser Ctrl-C cancellation works without regression
- ‚úÖ Gatekeeper lock released on cancellation
- ‚úÖ MCP commands can execute immediately after cancellation
- ‚úÖ All existing tests continue passing
- ‚úÖ E2E tests validate cancellation workflow
