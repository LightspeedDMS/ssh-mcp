# Story: Transparent User Experience

**As a** terminal user
**I want** my browser terminal experience unchanged by command tracking
**So that** I can continue working normally while system maintains state awareness

## Acceptance Criteria

#### Scenario 1: Normal Terminal Interaction
- [ ] **Given** user opens browser terminal
- [ ] **When** user types commands like `ls`, `cd`, `grep`
- [ ] **Then** commands execute with normal output and timing
- [ ] **And** no visible indication of command tracking
- [ ] **And** terminal responsiveness matches pre-tracking behavior

#### Scenario 2: Interactive Command Support
- [ ] **Given** user wants to run interactive commands
- [ ] **When** user executes `vim`, `nano`, or `less`
- [ ] **Then** interactive commands work fully with keyboard input
- [ ] **And** command tracking captures initial command only
- [ ] **And** interactive session functions normally

#### Scenario 3: Error Handling Transparency
- [ ] **Given** user executes command with errors
- [ ] **When** command fails or produces stderr output
- [ ] **Then** error messages display normally to user
- [ ] **And** command is still tracked in buffer despite errors
- [ ] **And** user sees same error behavior as without tracking

## Definition of Done

- ✅ **Zero User Impact**: Terminal behavior identical to pre-tracking
- ✅ **Performance Maintained**: No noticeable latency from tracking
- ✅ **Interactive Support**: Complex commands work normally
- ✅ **Error Transparency**: Failed commands handled gracefully
