# Story: SSH Session Termination and Re-establishment

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want the system to forcibly terminate and re-establish SSH sessions when nuclear fallback triggers so that hung connections are completely reset and functionality is restored.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 2.1: Force SSH Connection Termination
**Given** nuclear fallback timeout is triggered for a session  
**When** the SSH session termination begins  
**Then** the existing SSH client connection must be forcibly closed  
**And** all associated streams and channels must be terminated  
**And** the session must be marked as terminated  

### AC 2.2: Session State Preservation
**Given** an SSH session is being terminated for nuclear fallback  
**When** the termination process begins  
**Then** essential session configuration must be preserved  
**And** connection parameters (host, username, keyFilePath) must be stored  
**And** terminal dimensions must be remembered for reconnection  

### AC 2.3: Automatic Session Re-establishment
**Given** an SSH session has been terminated via nuclear fallback  
**When** the termination is complete  
**Then** a new SSH connection must be automatically established  
**And** the connection must use the same configuration parameters  
**And** the shell session must be properly initialized  

### AC 2.4: Re-establishment Failure Handling
**Given** nuclear fallback attempts to re-establish an SSH session  
**When** the reconnection fails  
**Then** the failure must be logged with diagnostic information  
**And** the session must remain in a failed state  
**And** clients must be notified of the permanent failure  

## Technical Requirements

- **Connection Termination**: Use `client.destroy()` for immediate disconnection
- **State Preservation**: Store `SSHConnectionConfig` before termination
- **Reconnection Logic**: Reuse existing `createConnection` workflow
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive failure scenarios and logging

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- SSH connection termination mechanics
- Configuration state preservation logic
- Reconnection parameter handling
- Failure scenario edge cases

### E2E Tests
- Complete termination and re-establishment workflow
- Real SSH connection kill and reconnect
- Terminal functionality after reconnection
- Failed reconnection scenario handling

## Definition of Done

- ✅ SSH connections terminate forcibly on nuclear fallback
- ✅ Essential session state is preserved during termination
- ✅ Sessions automatically re-establish with same configuration
- ✅ Re-establishment failures are handled gracefully
- ✅ Unit tests achieve >90% coverage
- ✅ E2E tests validate real SSH termination and reconnection
