# Story: State Cleanup and Notification

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want complete state cleanup and proper client notifications when nuclear fallback completes so that all components are synchronized and aware of the session reset.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 4.1: Browser Command Buffer Cleanup
**Given** nuclear fallback has completed session re-establishment  
**When** the cleanup phase begins  
**Then** the browser command buffer must be completely cleared  
**And** any pending browser commands must be marked as cancelled  
**And** the command gating state must be reset  

### AC 4.2: MCP Command State Reset
**Given** nuclear fallback is cleaning up session state  
**When** MCP command cleanup executes  
**Then** all pending MCP commands must be cleared or completed  
**And** the MCP command gating must be reset to allow new commands  
**And** MCP clients must be notified of the session reset  

### AC 4.3: Terminal Output Stream Notification
**Given** nuclear fallback has completed  
**When** clients are being notified  
**Then** WebSocket clients must receive a session reset notification  
**And** the notification must include the reason (nuclear fallback timeout)  
**And** terminal history must include a reset marker  

### AC 4.4: System Logging and Metrics
**Given** nuclear fallback cleanup is complete  
**When** the final state is established  
**Then** detailed logs must record the nuclear fallback event  
**And** metrics must track session reset frequency and success rate  
**And** diagnostic information must be available for troubleshooting  

## Technical Requirements

- **State Cleanup**: Clear all command buffers and reset gating mechanisms
- **Client Notifications**: WebSocket messages and MCP tool response updates
- **Logging Integration**: Comprehensive event logging with diagnostic context
- **Metrics Collection**: Track nuclear fallback frequency and patterns

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Browser command buffer cleanup logic
- MCP command state reset mechanisms
- Client notification message generation
- Logging and metrics collection

### E2E Tests
- Complete state cleanup after nuclear fallback
- Client notification delivery verification
- Browser and MCP client behavior post-cleanup
- End-to-end logging and metrics validation

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All command buffers are cleared after nuclear fallback
- ✅ Command gating is properly reset for new commands
- ✅ All clients receive appropriate reset notifications
- ✅ Comprehensive logging captures nuclear fallback events
- ✅ Unit tests achieve >90% coverage
- ✅ E2E tests validate complete cleanup and notification workflow
