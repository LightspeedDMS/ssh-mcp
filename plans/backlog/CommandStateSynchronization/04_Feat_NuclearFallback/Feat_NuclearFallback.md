# Feature: Nuclear Fallback

## Feature Description

Emergency recovery system that kills and re-establishes SSH sessions when command cancellation fails within 30 seconds, ensuring the system never hangs permanently regardless of command behavior.

## Technical Architecture

### Fallback Trigger
- 30-second timer starts when cancellation command issued
- Applies to both browser and MCP cancellation requests  
- Automatic SSH session termination and transparent reconnection

### Recovery Process
```
Cancellation Timeout → SSH Connection Kill → Session Re-establishment → State Cleanup → Client Notification
```

## Story Implementation Order

- [ ] 01_Story_CancellationTimeoutDetection
- [ ] 02_Story_SSHSessionTermination
- [ ] 03_Story_TransparentReconnection
- [ ] 04_Story_StateCleanupAndNotification

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites**: 
- 01_Feat_BrowserCommandTracking (for state cleanup)
- 02_Feat_MCPCommandGating (for gatekeeper reset)
- 03_Feat_CommandCancellation (triggers fallback mechanism)

## Success Criteria

- 🚀 **Never Hangs**: System recovers from any hung command within 30 seconds
- ✅ **Transparent Recovery**: Users/clients experience seamless reconnection
- 📊 **Complete Cleanup**: All command state cleared after nuclear reset
- ⚙️ **Gatekeeper Reset**: Command gating restored after session recovery

This feature ensures system reliability by providing guaranteed recovery from any command that becomes unresponsive to normal cancellation mechanisms.
