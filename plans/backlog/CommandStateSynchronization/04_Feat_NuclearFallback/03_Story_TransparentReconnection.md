# Story: Transparent Reconnection

## User Story
As a browser user or MCP client, I want nuclear fallback reconnection to be completely transparent so that I can continue using the terminal without any visible disruption or required intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 3.1: Seamless Browser Experience
**Given** a browser is connected to an SSH session during nuclear fallback  
**When** the session is terminated and re-established  
**Then** the browser WebSocket connection must remain active  
**And** terminal output must continue streaming without interruption  
**And** users must not see any disconnection messages  

### AC 3.2: MCP Client Continuity
**Given** MCP clients are using an SSH session during nuclear fallback  
**When** the session undergoes nuclear reset  
**Then** MCP commands must continue working normally  
**And** existing MCP tool calls must complete or fail gracefully  
**And** new MCP commands must execute on the re-established connection  

### AC 3.3: Terminal State Continuity
**Given** a terminal session has established state (current directory, environment)  
**When** nuclear fallback occurs  
**Then** the new session must restore the working directory  
**And** essential environment variables must be preserved  
**And** the terminal prompt must appear normally  

### AC 3.4: Connection Health Validation
**Given** nuclear fallback has completed session re-establishment  
**When** the new connection is established  
**Then** the connection health must be validated  
**And** a test command must execute successfully  
**And** terminal streaming must be confirmed working  

## Technical Requirements

- **WebSocket Continuity**: Maintain browser connections during SSH reset
- **State Restoration**: Execute `cd` and environment setup commands
- **Health Validation**: Run test commands to verify connection
- **Error Recovery**: Handle partial restoration failures gracefully

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- WebSocket connection preservation logic
- State restoration command generation
- Health validation mechanisms
- Partial failure recovery scenarios

### E2E Tests
- Browser WebSocket continuity during nuclear fallback
- MCP client functionality across session reset
- Terminal state preservation validation
- Complete transparent reconnection workflow

## Definition of Done

- ✅ Browser users see no visible interruption during nuclear fallback
- ✅ MCP clients continue working normally across session reset
- ✅ Terminal state (directory, environment) is restored
- ✅ Connection health is validated after re-establishment
- ✅ Unit tests achieve >90% coverage
- ✅ E2E tests validate complete transparency for all client types
