# Story: Dead Task Handling

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 04_Story_DeadTaskHandling
**Feature:** 03_Feat_PollingAPIImplementation
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## User Story
[Conversation Reference: User emphasized "Clean error messages for dead tasks (graceful failure)"]

As an MCP client monitoring background tasks
I want clean error messages when tasks die unexpectedly
So that I can understand task failures and handle them gracefully

## Problem Context
[Conversation Reference: User's emphasis on graceful failure handling]

Background tasks can die unexpectedly due to system issues, process failures, or other errors, requiring clear communication of failure states and clean error messaging.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Dead Task Detection
[Conversation Reference: User specified graceful failure for dead tasks]

```gherkin
Given a background task has died unexpectedly
When ssh_get_command_status is called
Then the dead task state is detected
And a clear error message is returned
And the failure reason is explained when possible
```

### Clean Error Messaging
[Conversation Reference: User emphasized "Clean error messages for dead tasks"]

```gherkin
Given a task has died or failed
When status is polled
Then the error message is clear and actionable
And the failure context is provided
And no technical jargon obscures the message
```

### Graceful Failure Information
[Conversation Reference: User specified "graceful failure"]

```gherkin
Given a task failure has occurred
When failure information is requested
Then comprehensive failure details are provided
And any partial results are made available
And recovery guidance is included when applicable
```

### Failure State Persistence
```gherkin
Given a task has died and been detected
When the failure state is recorded
Then the failure information persists in session storage
And subsequent status polls return consistent failure information
And failure details remain available for analysis
```

## Technical Implementation

### Dead Task Detection
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's dead task handling requirement]

- **Process Monitoring**: Monitor background thread and process health
- **Health Checking**: Implement periodic health checks for running tasks
- **Failure Detection**: Detect when threads or processes die unexpectedly
- **State Transition**: Transition task state to 'failed' when death detected

### Error Message Generation
[Conversation Reference: User emphasized clean error messages]

```typescript
interface DeadTaskError {
  taskState: 'failed';
  failureReason: string;
  failureTime: Date;
  partialResults?: {
    stdout: string;
    stderr: string;
    lastOutput: Date;
  };
  recoveryGuidance?: string;
  errorCode: string;
}
```

### Failure Classification
- **Process Death**: Process terminated unexpectedly
- **Thread Failure**: Background thread crashed or hung
- **System Error**: System-level failures affecting task execution
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Out of memory or resource failures

## Implementation Steps

1. **Health Monitoring**: Implement task health monitoring system
2. **Failure Detection**: Create failure detection mechanisms
3. **Error Classification**: Classify different types of task failures
4. **Message Generation**: Generate clean, actionable error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Failure Simulation Testing
- **Process Termination**: Simulate unexpected process termination
- **Thread Crashes**: Test thread failure scenarios
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Test resource-related failures

### Error Message Testing
- **Message Clarity**: Verify error messages are clear and actionable
- **Information Completeness**: Test error information completeness
- **Recovery Guidance**: Validate recovery guidance accuracy

## Error Message Examples

### Process Death Error
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sessionName": "user-session-123",
  "taskState": "failed",
  "error": {
    "failureReason": "Background process terminated unexpectedly",
    "failureTime": "2025-09-20T10:12:45.000Z",
    "partialResults": {
      "stdout": "Processing file 1 of 100...\nProcessing file 2 of 100...\n",
      "stderr": "Warning: Low disk space\n",
      "lastOutput": "2025-09-20T10:12:40.000Z"
    },
    "recoveryGuidance": "Check system resources and try running the command again",
    "errorCode": "PROCESS_TERMINATED"
  }
}
```

### Resource Exhaustion Error
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sessionName": "user-session-123",
  "taskState": "failed",
  "error": {
    "failureReason": "Command failed due to insufficient memory",
    "failureTime": "2025-09-20T10:08:30.000Z",
    "partialResults": {
      "stdout": "Loading data...\nAllocating memory...\n",
      "stderr": "Fatal error: Out of memory\n",
      "lastOutput": "2025-09-20T10:08:29.000Z"
    },
    "recoveryGuidance": "Increase available memory or reduce command scope",
    "errorCode": "MEMORY_EXHAUSTED"
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

### Health Monitoring Integration
[Conversation Reference: User's requirement for dead task detection]

- **Thread Monitoring**: Monitor background thread health
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitor SSH process and command execution
- **System Integration**: Integrate with system monitoring capabilities
- **Alert Generation**: Generate alerts when failures detected

### Session Storage Integration
- **Failure State Storage**: Store failure information in session data
- **Partial Result Storage**: Store any partial results before failure
- **Error Context Storage**: Store failure context and recovery information
- **State Consistency**: Maintain consistent failure state across polls

## Failure Recovery Considerations

### Partial Result Preservation
[Conversation Reference: User's graceful failure philosophy]

- **Output Preservation**: Preserve any output produced before failure
- **Progress Tracking**: Track and preserve progress information
- **Context Preservation**: Preserve execution context for analysis
- **Recovery Planning**: Provide guidance for recovery attempts

### Error Context
- **Failure Timing**: Provide accurate failure timing information
- **System State**: Include relevant system state at failure time
- **Resource Status**: Include resource utilization at failure
- **Environmental Factors**: Include environmental factors affecting failure

## Risk Mitigation

### Detection Accuracy
- **False Positives**: Incorrectly detecting healthy tasks as dead
  - *Mitigation*: Robust health checking with appropriate timeouts
- **False Negatives**: Missing actual task failures

  - *Mitigation*: User testing and message validation procedures
- **Information Accuracy**: Ensuring failure information is accurate
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and validation of error detection

### System Impact
