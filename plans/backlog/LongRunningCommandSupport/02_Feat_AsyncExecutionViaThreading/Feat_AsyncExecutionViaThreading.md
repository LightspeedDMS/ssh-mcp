# Feature: Async Execution via Threading

## Feature Overview
**Feature ID:** 02_Feat_AsyncExecutionViaThreading
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## Problem Statement
[Conversation Reference: User outlined "Use threaded task approach for MCP commands with optional asyncTimeout parameter", "Browser commands infinite wait (no timeout mechanism)", "Timed wait with timeout → return error to MCP client → keep task running in background", "Store task reference in session for polling"]

Current synchronous command execution blocks MCP clients and prevents background task continuation after client timeouts.

## Solution Approach
[Conversation Reference: User specified threaded execution model with session-based task storage]

Implement threaded task execution where MCP commands can timeout and return errors while tasks continue running in background threads, with task references stored in session for polling access.

## User Stories

### Story Breakdown
- [ ] **01_Story_ThreadedTaskExecution** - Implement background thread execution for commands
- [ ] **02_Story_SessionTaskStorage** - Store task references in session for polling access
- [ ] **03_Story_AsyncTimeoutHandling** - Handle MCP client timeouts with error responses
- [ ] **04_Story_UnifiedCodePath** - Ensure browser and MCP use identical execution path

## Acceptance Criteria

### Threaded Task Execution
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Use threaded task approach for MCP commands with optional asyncTimeout parameter"]

```gherkin
Given an MCP command is executed with asyncTimeout parameter
When the command execution begins
Then the command runs in a background thread
And the main thread remains available for other operations
And the background task continues regardless of client timeouts
```

### Session Task Storage
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Store task reference in session for polling"]

```gherkin
Given a command is executing in a background thread
When the task starts execution
Then the task reference is stored in the session
And the task state is tracked in session data
And the task remains accessible for polling
```

### Async Timeout Error Response
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Timed wait with timeout → return error to MCP client → keep task running in background"]

```gherkin
Given an MCP command with asyncTimeout parameter
When the timeout is reached before command completion
Then an error response is returned to the MCP client
And the background task continues executing
And the task remains available for status polling
```

### Browser Infinite Wait
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Browser commands infinite wait (no timeout mechanism)"]

```gherkin
Given a command is executed from the browser terminal
When the command runs for extended periods
Then the browser waits infinitely for completion
And no timeout mechanism interrupts execution
And the user sees real-time output streaming
```

## Technical Implementation

### Threading Architecture
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's threaded task approach]

- **Background Execution**: Commands execute in separate threads
- **Main Thread Availability**: Main thread remains responsive during execution
- **Task Isolation**: Each session manages independent task threads
- **Resource Management**: Proper thread cleanup and resource management

### Session Integration
[Conversation Reference: User specified session-based task storage]

- **Task References**: Store thread references in session data
- **State Tracking**: Maintain task state (running/completed/failed/cancelled)
- **Result Storage**: Persist task output and exit codes in session
- **Cleanup Management**: Handle task cleanup when sessions terminate

## Dependencies
**Requires**: Feature 1 (Timeout Architecture Cleanup) must be completed
**Blocks**: Features 3 and 4 depend on threaded execution foundation

## Testing Strategy

### Threading Validation
- **Background Execution**: Verify commands run in separate threads
- **Main Thread Responsiveness**: Confirm main thread remains available
- **Task Isolation**: Test multiple concurrent tasks across sessions

### Session Storage Testing
- **Task Reference Storage**: Verify task references persist in session
- **State Tracking**: Validate task state updates correctly
- **Result Persistence**: Confirm output and exit codes stored properly

## Success Criteria

### Core Threading
✅ **Background Execution**: Commands execute in background threads
✅ **Session Storage**: Task references stored in session for polling
✅ **Async Timeout Handling**: MCP clients receive timeout errors while tasks continue
✅ **Unified Code Path**: Browser and MCP commands use identical execution path

### Integration Requirements
✅ **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization for session data access
✅ **Resource Management**: Clean thread cleanup and resource handling
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for thread failures
✅ **State Consistency**: Consistent task state across thread boundaries

## Risk Mitigation

### Threading Risks
- **Resource Leaks**: Background threads not properly cleaned up
  - *Mitigation*: Proper thread lifecycle management and cleanup procedures
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access to session data
  - *Mitigation*: Thread-safe session data access with proper synchronization

### Session Management Risks
- **State Corruption**: Invalid task references or state inconsistencies
  - *Mitigation*: Atomic state updates and validation checks
- **Memory Growth**: Unbounded task reference accumulation
  - *Mitigation*: Session-based isolation and explicit cleanup interfaces
