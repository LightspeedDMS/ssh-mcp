# Story: Session Task Storage

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 02_Story_SessionTaskStorage
**Feature:** 02_Feat_AsyncExecutionViaThreading
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## User Story
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Store task reference in session for polling"]

As a system administrator managing background tasks
I want task references stored in session data
So that I can poll task status and retrieve results after MCP client timeouts

## Problem Context
[Conversation Reference: User's polling architecture requires session-based task storage]

Background tasks need persistent references that survive MCP client timeouts to enable status polling and result retrieval from subsequent client connections.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Task Reference Storage
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Store task reference in session for polling"]

```gherkin
Given a command is executed in a background thread
When the thread begins execution
Then the task reference is stored in the session data
And the task reference remains accessible for polling
And the reference persists across MCP client connections
```

### Task State Tracking
```gherkin
Given a background task is executing
When the task state changes (running/completed/failed/cancelled)
Then the state is updated in the session storage
And the state change is immediately available for polling
And state history is maintained for debugging
```

### Task Result Persistence
```gherkin
Given a background task completes execution
When the task produces output, errors, or exit codes
Then all results are stored in the session data
And results remain accessible until explicitly cleared
And complete output is preserved without truncation
```

### Session Isolation
```gherkin
Given multiple sessions have background tasks
When task references are stored
Then each session maintains isolated task storage
And tasks from different sessions do not interfere
And session-specific task access is enforced
```

## Technical Implementation

### Session Data Structure
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's session-based storage requirement]

```typescript
interface SessionTaskData {
  taskReference: ThreadReference;
  taskState: 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  startTime: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  command: string;
  stdout: string;
  stderr: string;
  exitCode?: number;
  lastActivity: Date;
}
```

### Storage Operations
- **Task Registration**: Store task reference when thread starts
- **State Updates**: Update task state as execution progresses
- **Result Storage**: Store output, errors, and exit codes
- **Task Cleanup**: Remove task data when explicitly cleared

## Implementation Steps

1. **Session Schema Extension**: Add task storage fields to session data
2. **Storage Interface**: Implement task storage and retrieval operations
3. **State Synchronization**: Ensure thread state updates session storage
4. **Cleanup Procedures**: Implement task data cleanup mechanisms

## Testing Strategy

### Storage Validation
- **Task Registration**: Verify task references stored correctly
- **State Synchronization**: Test state updates from background threads
- **Result Persistence**: Validate output and exit code storage

### Isolation Testing
- **Session Boundaries**: Test task isolation between sessions
- **Concurrent Tasks**: Verify multiple concurrent task storage
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure session data remains consistent

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Task references stored in session data when threads start
- [ ] Task state tracked and updated in real-time
- [ ] Complete task results (stdout/stderr/exit codes) persisted
- [ ] Session isolation maintained for task storage

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Thread-safe session data access for task storage
- [ ] Efficient storage and retrieval operations
- [ ] Proper cleanup mechanisms for completed tasks
- [ ] Memory management for task result storage

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Task references accessible after thread creation
- [ ] State updates reflected immediately in session storage
- [ ] Complete task results retrievable after completion
- [ ] Session isolation verified across multiple concurrent tasks

## Integration Points

### Threading Integration
[Conversation Reference: User's threaded task approach with session storage]

- **Thread Registration**: Register new threads with session storage
- **State Callbacks**: Receive state updates from background threads
- **Result Collection**: Collect thread results into session storage
- **Cleanup Coordination**: Coordinate thread cleanup with storage cleanup

### Polling API Preparation
[Conversation Reference: User specified polling access to stored tasks]

- **Query Interface**: Prepare session data for polling queries
- **State Access**: Enable task state retrieval from session storage
- **Result Access**: Enable task result retrieval from session storage
- **History Access**: Enable task execution history access

## Session Data Management

### Storage Lifecycle
```
Thread Start → Task Registration → State Tracking → Result Storage → Cleanup
```

### Data Retention
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's polling requirement]

- **Persistence Duration**: Task data persists until explicitly cleared
- **Memory Management**: Efficient storage of task results
- **Cleanup Triggers**: Clear task data when new commands start

## Risk Mitigation

### Memory Management
- **Unbounded Growth**: Task data accumulating without cleanup
  - *Mitigation*: Explicit cleanup mechanisms and memory monitoring
- **Large Output Storage**: Commands with extensive output consuming memory
  - *Mitigation*: Output size limits and efficient storage strategies

### Data Integrity
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple threads accessing session data simultaneously
  - *Mitigation*: Thread-safe data structures and proper synchronization
- **State Corruption**: Invalid state updates corrupting session data
  - *Mitigation*: Atomic updates and data validation checks

## Performance Considerations

### Storage Efficiency
- **Fast Access**: Quick task reference lookup and state retrieval
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient storage of task results and state
- **Update Performance**: Fast state updates from background threads

### Scalability
- **Multiple Tasks**: Support for reasonable number of concurrent tasks per session
- **Large Output**: Handle commands with significant output efficiently
- **Session Count**: Scale across multiple active sessions
