# Story: Threaded Task Execution

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 01_Story_ThreadedTaskExecution
**Feature:** 02_Feat_AsyncExecutionViaThreading
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## User Story
[Conversation Reference: User outlined "Use threaded task approach for MCP commands with optional asyncTimeout parameter"]

As a system administrator executing commands via MCP
I want commands to run in background threads
So that my MCP client remains responsive while long-running commands execute

## Problem Context
[Conversation Reference: User specified threaded approach to enable background execution]

Current synchronous execution blocks MCP clients during command execution, preventing client responsiveness and interfering with other operations during long-running commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Background Thread Execution
[Conversation Reference: User specified "threaded task approach for MCP commands"]

```gherkin
Given an MCP command is executed
When the command begins execution
Then the command runs in a dedicated background thread
And the main MCP server thread remains available
And the MCP client can continue with other operations
```

### AsyncTimeout Parameter Support
[Conversation Reference: User specified "optional asyncTimeout parameter"]

```gherkin
Given an MCP command includes asyncTimeout parameter
When the command is executed
Then the asyncTimeout value is applied to the background thread
And timeout handling occurs within the background thread context
And the main thread is not blocked by timeout operations
```

### Thread Isolation
```gherkin
Given multiple commands are executed across different sessions
When commands run in background threads
Then each command executes in an isolated thread
And threads do not interfere with each other
And session isolation is maintained at the thread level
```

### Resource Management
```gherkin
Given a background thread is executing a command
When the command completes or fails
Then the thread resources are properly cleaned up
And no thread leaks occur
And memory usage is properly managed
```

## Technical Implementation

### Threading Model
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's threaded task approach]

- **Dedicated Threads**: Each command gets its own background thread
- **Thread Pool Management**: Efficient thread allocation and reuse
- **Isolation Guarantees**: Thread-level isolation for session commands
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Automatic thread resource cleanup

### AsyncTimeout Integration
[Conversation Reference: User specified optional asyncTimeout parameter]

- **Parameter Handling**: Accept and process asyncTimeout parameter
- **Thread-Level Timeouts**: Apply timeouts within background threads
- **Timeout Responses**: Generate appropriate timeout responses
- **Background Continuation**: Allow tasks to continue after timeout

## Implementation Steps

1. **Thread Infrastructure**: Implement background thread execution framework
2. **Parameter Processing**: Add asyncTimeout parameter handling
3. **Session Integration**: Integrate threaded execution with session management
4. **Resource Management**: Implement proper thread cleanup procedures

## Testing Strategy

### Threading Validation
- **Background Execution**: Verify commands execute in separate threads
- **Main Thread Availability**: Confirm main thread remains responsive
- **Thread Isolation**: Test isolation between concurrent commands

### Timeout Testing
- **AsyncTimeout Handling**: Verify timeout parameter processing
- **Background Continuation**: Test task continuation after timeout
- **Resource Cleanup**: Validate proper thread cleanup

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Commands execute in dedicated background threads
- [ ] AsyncTimeout parameter supported and processed
- [ ] Main MCP server thread remains responsive during execution
- [ ] Thread isolation maintained between sessions

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Proper thread resource management and cleanup
- [ ] Thread-safe session data access
- [ ] Error handling for thread failures
- [ ] Performance optimization for thread creation

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Background thread execution verified through testing
- [ ] AsyncTimeout parameter functionality confirmed
- [ ] Thread isolation validated across multiple sessions
- [ ] Resource cleanup verified to prevent leaks

## Integration Points

### Session Management
[Conversation Reference: User specified session-based task storage]

- **Thread Registration**: Register threads with session management
- **State Synchronization**: Synchronize thread state with session data
- **Cleanup Coordination**: Coordinate thread cleanup with session lifecycle

### MCP Protocol
- **Response Handling**: Manage MCP responses from background threads
- **Error Propagation**: Propagate thread errors to MCP clients
- **Timeout Communication**: Communicate timeout events to MCP clients

## Risk Mitigation

### Threading Risks
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Too many background threads consuming resources
  - *Mitigation*: Thread pool management and session-based limits
- **Thread Synchronization**: Race conditions in shared data access
  - *Mitigation*: Thread-safe data structures and synchronization primitives

### Performance Risks
- **Thread Creation Overhead**: Performance impact of frequent thread creation
  - *Mitigation*: Thread pool reuse and efficient thread management
- **Memory Usage**: Background threads consuming excessive memory
  - *Mitigation*: Resource monitoring and proper cleanup procedures
