# Feature: Browser Long Command Compatibility

## Feature Overview
**Feature ID:** 03_Feat_BrowserLongCommandCompatibility
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-09-15

## Feature Description
Ensure browser terminals continue to wait forever for long-running commands without any timeout changes. The browser experience remains exactly the same - commands run indefinitely, output streams in real-time, and users can monitor progress. No changes to browser timeout behavior.

## Business Value
### Problem Addressed
Browser users need to execute and monitor long-running commands just like traditional SSH terminals, without artificial timeouts or interruptions. The new async architecture must not degrade the browser experience.

### Solution Provided
- Browser continues waiting forever (no timeout changes)
- Real-time output streaming unchanged
- Receives cancellation notifications when MCP cancels
- Transparent async mode (browser unaware)

## Technical Design
### Architecture Components
1. **No Timeout Changes**: Browser WebSocket continues waiting forever
2. **Output Streaming**: Existing real-time output continues working
3. **Notification Reception**: Browser receives cancellation messages

### Dual-Mode Operation
```
Browser Command → Execute → Stream Output → Complete/Cancel
                     ↓
              (>60s triggers async internally)
                     ↓
            Browser unaware, continues streaming
```

### Integration Points
- WebSocket maintains persistent connection
- Output streams directly to terminal
- Async mode transparent to browser
- Cancellation available via Ctrl+C

## User Stories

### Story Breakdown
[ ] **01_Story_BrowserInfiniteWait** - Complete browser long-command support

### Story Dependencies
- Can develop in parallel with Features 1-2
- Benefits from async infrastructure when available

## Acceptance Criteria

Feature: Browser Long Command Compatibility
  As a browser terminal user
  I want to run long commands without timeouts
  So that I can perform lengthy operations through the web interface

  Scenario: Browser executes long-running command
    Given I'm using the browser terminal
    When I execute "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y"
    Then the command runs without timeout
    And I see real-time output streaming
    And the terminal remains responsive to Ctrl+C

  Scenario: Transparent async mode transition
    Given I execute a command taking >60 seconds
    When the system switches to async mode internally
    Then my browser experience remains unchanged
    And output continues streaming in real-time
    And I'm unaware of the mode change

  Scenario: Browser-initiated cancellation
    Given I'm running a long command in browser
    When I press Ctrl+C
    Then the command terminates promptly
    And I see "^C" in the terminal
    And the prompt returns

  Scenario: MCP cancellation notification received
    Given I'm running a long command in browser
    When an MCP client cancels it
    Then I see "[CANCELLED] Command terminated by MCP client"
    And the prompt returns

  Scenario: Reconnection to long-running command
    Given I started a long command and disconnected
    When I reconnect to the session
    Then I see the command still running
    And missed output is replayed
    And I can continue monitoring
```

## Implementation Requirements
### Technical Specifications
1. **No Changes Required**
   - Browser WebSocket already waits forever
   - Output streaming already works
   - Just ensure no new timeouts added

### Browser Behavior
- Continues waiting indefinitely
- Shows all output and notifications
- No new UI elements needed

## Testing Strategy
### Test Scenarios
1. **Duration Tests**
   - sleep 120 - verify browser waits
   - sleep 65 - verify no timeout
   - Long output commands work

2. **Cancellation Reception**
   - Browser shows cancellation message
   - Terminal returns to prompt

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Chromium
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Mobile browsers

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- WebSocket infrastructure
- Terminal emulator (xterm.js)
- Browser JavaScript runtime
- Session state management

### Integration Dependencies
- Can work independently
- Enhanced by Features 1-2
- WebSocket server modifications

## Risk Mitigation
### Identified Risks
1. **Connection Stability**
   - Risk: WebSocket disconnect during long operations
   - Mitigation: Automatic reconnection with buffering

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Risk: Large output consuming browser memory
   - Mitigation: Streaming with limited buffering

3. **Browser Timeouts**
   - Risk: Browser or proxy timeouts
   - Mitigation: Keepalive messages

## Success Metrics
- Commands run indefinitely without timeout
- Zero browser disconnections due to duration
- Output latency <100ms
- Cancellation response <1 second
- Browser memory usage <100MB

## Documentation Requirements
- Browser terminal user guide
- Long-running command best practices
- Troubleshooting connection issues
- Performance tuning guide

## Release Criteria
- All long-duration tests passing
- Browser compatibility verified
- Performance benchmarks met
- User documentation complete
- Integration tests validated
