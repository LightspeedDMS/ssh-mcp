# Story: Queue Staleness Removal

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 02_Story_QueueStalenessRemoval
**Feature:** 01_Feat_TimeoutArchitectureCleanup
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## User Story
[Conversation Reference: User stated "Remove queue staleness timeouts (5-minute expiry) - replace with infinite wait + explicit cancellation"]

As a system administrator executing long-running commands
I want queue staleness timeouts removed
So that commands wait infinitely until explicit cancellation instead of automatic expiry

## Problem Context
[Conversation Reference: User specified replacement approach "replace with infinite wait + explicit cancellation"]

The current 5-minute queue expiry system introduces artificial time limits that conflict with long-running command requirements and the infinite wait + explicit cancellation architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Queue Staleness Timeout Removal
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Remove queue staleness timeouts (5-minute expiry)"]

```gherkin
Given the current command queue with 5-minute staleness expiry
When commands are queued for execution
Then no automatic queue expiration occurs
And commands remain in queue indefinitely
And only explicit cancellation removes queued commands
```

### Infinite Wait Implementation
[Conversation Reference: User specified "replace with infinite wait + explicit cancellation"]

```gherkin
Given a command is queued for execution
When 5 minutes elapse without execution
Then the command remains queued for execution
And no staleness timeout triggers
And the command waits indefinitely for execution opportunity
```

### Explicit Cancellation Only
```gherkin
Given commands are waiting in the queue
When queue management is required
Then only explicit cancellation can remove commands
And no automatic expiry mechanisms exist
And queue persistence is maintained indefinitely
```

## Technical Implementation

### Code Removal Targets
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's identification of 5-minute expiry system]

- **Staleness Timer Logic**: Remove 5-minute expiry mechanisms
- **Queue Expiry Handlers**: Remove automatic queue cleanup
- **Timeout Tracking**: Remove staleness timestamp tracking
- **Expiry Events**: Remove queue expiration event triggers

### Implementation Steps
1. **Identify Staleness Code**: Locate all 5-minute expiry logic
2. **Remove Expiry Timers**: Eliminate automatic queue expiration
3. **Preserve Queue State**: Maintain queue persistence indefinitely
4. **Prepare Cancellation Interface**: Ready queue for explicit cancellation

## Queue Lifecycle Changes

### Before: Automatic Expiry
```
Command Queued → 5 Minute Timer → Automatic Expiry → Queue Cleared
```

### After: Infinite Persistence
[Conversation Reference: User's infinite wait + explicit cancellation model]

```
Command Queued → Infinite Wait → Explicit Cancellation → Queue Cleared
```

## Testing Strategy

### Infinite Wait Validation
- **Queue Persistence**: Verify commands remain queued beyond 5 minutes
- **No Automatic Expiry**: Confirm absence of staleness timeouts
- **Long Duration Testing**: Test queue behavior over extended periods

### Regression Testing
- **Queue Functionality**: Ensure basic queue operations still work
- **Command Execution**: Verify queued commands execute properly
- **Session Management**: Confirm session lifecycle unaffected

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] 5-minute queue staleness timeout completely removed
- [ ] Commands wait in queue indefinitely without expiry
- [ ] No automatic queue expiration mechanisms remain
- [ ] Queue state persists until explicit cancellation

### Architecture Requirements
- [ ] Infinite wait capability implemented
- [ ] Explicit cancellation interface prepared
- [ ] No timing-based queue management logic
- [ ] Clean queue persistence without staleness tracking

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Commands remain queued beyond 5-minute threshold
- [ ] No automatic queue cleanup occurs
- [ ] Queue state maintained across extended durations
- [ ] Only explicit actions can modify queue state

## Risk Mitigation

### Resource Management
- **Memory Growth**: Queues growing indefinitely without cleanup
  - *Mitigation*: Explicit cancellation mechanisms in subsequent features
- **Queue Overflow**: Too many persistent commands
  - *Mitigation*: Single active task per session limits queue growth

### System Stability
- **Resource Leaks**: Queue state accumulating without bounds
  - *Mitigation*: Session-based isolation and explicit cleanup interfaces
