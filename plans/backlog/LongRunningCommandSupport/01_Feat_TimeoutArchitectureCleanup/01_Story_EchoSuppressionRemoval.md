# Story: Echo Suppression Removal

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 01_Story_EchoSuppressionRemoval
**Feature:** 01_Feat_TimeoutArchitectureCleanup
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## User Story
[Conversation Reference: User stated "Remove echo suppression system (100ms window) - over-engineered for current architecture"]

As a system administrator executing commands
I want echo suppression timing windows removed
So that command output is immediately available without artificial delays

## Problem Context
[Conversation Reference: User identified echo suppression as "over-engineered for current architecture"]

The current 100ms echo suppression window introduces unnecessary complexity and delays in command output processing, creating artificial timing dependencies that conflict with the infinite wait architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Echo Suppression Window Removal
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Remove echo suppression system (100ms window)"]

```gherkin
Given the current command execution system with 100ms echo suppression
When a command produces output
Then the output is immediately processed without timing delays
And no 100ms window suppression occurs
And all command echoes are processed in real-time
```

### Immediate Output Availability
```gherkin
Given a command is executed via MCP or browser
When the command produces stdout or stderr output
Then the output is immediately available for consumption
And no artificial delays are introduced
And output streaming occurs without suppression windows
```

### Clean Code Architecture
```gherkin
Given the echo suppression removal is complete
When reviewing the codebase
Then no 100ms timing window code remains
And no echo suppression logic exists
And output processing is simplified without timing dependencies
```

## Technical Implementation

### Code Removal Targets
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's identification of echo suppression as over-engineered]

- **Timing Window Logic**: Remove 100ms delay mechanisms
- **Echo Suppression Handlers**: Remove suppression timing code
- **Output Buffering**: Remove timing-based output buffering
- **Suppression State**: Remove echo suppression state tracking

### Implementation Steps
1. **Identify Suppression Code**: Locate all 100ms window timing logic
2. **Remove Timing Delays**: Eliminate artificial timing constraints
3. **Simplify Output Processing**: Direct output processing without suppression
4. **Clean State Management**: Remove suppression-related state fields

## Testing Strategy

### Immediate Output Validation
- **Real-time Processing**: Verify output appears immediately
- **No Artificial Delays**: Confirm absence of 100ms delays
- **Stream Continuity**: Validate uninterrupted output streaming

### Regression Testing
- **Command Execution**: Ensure basic command execution still works
- **Browser Terminal**: Verify browser terminal output unaffected
- **MCP Response**: Confirm MCP clients receive immediate output
