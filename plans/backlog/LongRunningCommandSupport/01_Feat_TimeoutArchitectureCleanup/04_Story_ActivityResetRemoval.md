# Story: Activity Reset Removal

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 04_Story_ActivityResetRemoval
**Feature:** 01_Feat_TimeoutArchitectureCleanup
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## User Story
[Conversation Reference: User stated "Remove activity-reset timeout - replace with infinite real timeout"]

As a system administrator executing long-running commands
I want activity-reset timeouts removed
So that commands continue indefinitely without activity-based termination

## Problem Context
[Conversation Reference: User specified "replace with infinite real timeout"]

The current activity-reset timeout system introduces arbitrary command termination based on activity patterns, conflicting with the infinite wait architecture where only explicit cancellation should terminate commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Activity Reset Timeout Removal
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Remove activity-reset timeout"]

```gherkin
Given the current command execution with activity-reset timeouts
When commands execute for extended periods without activity
Then no activity-based termination occurs
And commands continue running indefinitely
And only explicit cancellation can terminate commands
```

### Infinite Real Timeout Implementation
[Conversation Reference: User specified "replace with infinite real timeout"]

```gherkin
Given a command is executing with minimal activity
When extended periods pass without command output
Then the command continues executing indefinitely
And no activity-reset triggers occur
And command persistence is maintained regardless of activity level
```

### Activity-Independent Execution
```gherkin
Given commands with varying activity patterns
When commands execute for long durations
Then execution continues regardless of activity frequency
And no timeout resets based on activity occur
And command lifecycle is independent of activity patterns
```

## Technical Implementation

### Code Removal Targets
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's identification of activity-reset timeout system]

- **Activity Reset Logic**: Remove activity-based timeout mechanisms
- **Activity Tracking**: Remove activity pattern monitoring
- **Reset Triggers**: Remove timeout reset based on activity
- **Activity Timers**: Remove activity-dependent timing systems

### Implementation Steps
1. **Identify Activity Reset Code**: Locate all activity-reset timeout logic
2. **Remove Activity Monitoring**: Eliminate activity pattern tracking
3. **Remove Reset Mechanisms**: Remove timeout reset triggers
4. **Implement Infinite Execution**: Enable commands to run indefinitely

## Execution Model Changes

### Before: Activity-Based Resets
```
Command Start → Activity Monitor → Reset on Activity → Timeout on Inactivity → Termination
```

### After: Infinite Execution
[Conversation Reference: User's infinite real timeout model]

```
Command Start → Infinite Execution → Explicit Cancellation → Termination
```

## Testing Strategy

### Infinite Execution Validation
- **Low Activity Commands**: Verify commands continue with minimal output
- **Variable Activity**: Test commands with inconsistent activity patterns
- **Extended Duration**: Validate execution beyond typical activity-reset thresholds

### Regression Testing
- **Command Execution**: Ensure basic command functionality preserved
- **Output Streaming**: Verify output continues regardless of activity
- **Termination Control**: Confirm only explicit cancellation works

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Activity-reset timeout system completely removed
- [ ] Commands execute indefinitely regardless of activity level
- [ ] No activity-based termination mechanisms remain
- [ ] Infinite execution capability implemented

### Architecture Requirements
- [ ] Activity-independent command execution
- [ ] No timeout reset logic based on activity patterns
- [ ] Clean execution model without activity monitoring
- [ ] Explicit cancellation as only termination method

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Commands with low activity continue indefinitely
- [ ] No activity-based timeouts trigger
- [ ] Command execution independent of output frequency
- [ ] Only explicit cancellation terminates commands

## Long-Running Command Support

### Activity Pattern Independence
[Conversation Reference: User's infinite real timeout architecture]

- **Batch Processing**: Commands with sporadic output continue indefinitely
- **System Monitoring**: Long-running monitoring commands persist
- **Data Processing**: Commands with variable activity patterns supported
- **Background Tasks**: Tasks with minimal activity execute without termination

### Explicit Control Model
- **Intentional Termination**: Only explicit cancellation terminates commands
- **Predictable Behavior**: Command lifecycle independent of activity patterns
- **User Control**: Users control command termination explicitly

## Risk Mitigation

### Resource Management
- **Runaway Processes**: Commands continuing indefinitely without control
  - *Mitigation*: Explicit cancellation mechanisms provide command control
- **Resource Consumption**: Long-running commands consuming system resources
  - *Mitigation*: Session-based isolation and cancellation capabilities

### System Stability
- **Process Accumulation**: Commands accumulating without automatic cleanup
  - *Mitigation*: Single active task per session limits process count
- **System Load**: Multiple infinite commands affecting system performance
  - *Mitigation*: Session management and explicit cancellation provide control

## Preparation for Cancellation System

### Cancellation Interface Readiness
[Conversation Reference: User specified explicit cancellation as replacement]

- **Command References**: Maintain command references for cancellation
- **Process Tracking**: Track command processes for termination
- **Cancellation Points**: Prepare interfaces for explicit command termination
- **State Management**: Maintain cancellation state for proper cleanup
