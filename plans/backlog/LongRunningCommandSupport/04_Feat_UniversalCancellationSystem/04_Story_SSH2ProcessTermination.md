# Story: SSH2 Process Termination

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 04_Story_SSH2ProcessTermination
**Feature:** 04_Feat_UniversalCancellationSystem
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## User Story
[Conversation Reference: User specified "SSH2 library cancellation via stream.write('\x03') + stream.destroy()"]

As a system implementing command cancellation
I want to terminate SSH processes using SSH2 library methods
So that commands are properly cancelled and SSH resources are cleanly released

## Problem Context
[Conversation Reference: User's specific SSH2 library termination requirement]

Background tasks executing via SSH connections need proper termination using SSH2 library methods to ensure processes are actually killed and SSH resources are properly cleaned up.

## Acceptance Criteria

### SSH2 Signal Transmission
[Conversation Reference: User specified "stream.write('\x03')"]

```gherkin
Given a command is executing via SSH connection
When cancellation is processed
Then stream.write('\x03') is called to send interrupt signal
And the interrupt signal is transmitted to the remote process
And the signal reaches the executing command
```

### SSH2 Stream Destruction
[Conversation Reference: User specified "stream.destroy()"]

```gherkin
Given the interrupt signal has been sent
When stream termination occurs
Then stream.destroy() is called to terminate the SSH stream
And the SSH connection resources are properly released
And no lingering connections remain
```

### Process Termination Verification
```gherkin
Given SSH2 termination methods are applied
When termination completes
Then the remote process is actually terminated
And no zombie processes remain on the remote system
And SSH resources are fully cleaned up
```

### Error Handling
```gherkin
Given SSH2 termination encounters errors
When termination fails or encounters issues
Then fallback termination methods are attempted
And error information is captured for diagnosis
And graceful degradation occurs
```

## Technical Implementation

### SSH2 Termination Sequence
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's specific SSH2 method sequence]

```typescript
class SSH2ProcessTerminator {
  async terminateProcess(sshStream: SSH2Stream, processInfo: ProcessInfo): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Step 1: Send interrupt signal
      await this.sendInterruptSignal(sshStream);

      // Step 2: Wait for graceful termination
      await this.waitForTermination(processInfo, 1000); // 1 second timeout

      // Step 3: Force destroy stream if still running
      await this.destroyStream(sshStream);

      // Step 4: Verify termination
      await this.verifyTermination(processInfo);

    } catch (error) {
      // Step 5: Fallback termination
      await this.forceTermination(sshStream, processInfo);
    }
  }

  private async sendInterruptSignal(stream: SSH2Stream): Promise<void> {
    // User specified method: stream.write('\x03')
    stream.write('\x03');
  }

  private async destroyStream(stream: SSH2Stream): Promise<void> {
    // User specified method: stream.destroy()
    stream.destroy();
  }
}
```

### Implementation Components
- **Signal Transmission**: Send Ctrl-C interrupt signal via SSH stream

- **Session Cleanup**: Update session state after termination
- **Memory Cleanup**: Release any allocated memory for terminated process

## Implementation Steps

1. **SSH2 Integration**: Integrate with existing SSH2 connection management
2. **Termination Sequence**: Implement interrupt signal and stream destruction
3. **Verification Logic**: Implement process termination verification
4. **Error Handling**: Implement fallback termination methods

```typescript
// Handle various termination failure scenarios
if (!await this.gracefulTermination(stream)) {
  if (!await this.forceTermination(stream)) {
    if (!await this.connectionTermination(connection)) {
      // Log error and mark as failed termination
      await this.handleTerminationFailure(processInfo);
