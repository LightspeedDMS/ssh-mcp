# Feature: Universal Cancellation System

## Feature Overview
**Feature ID:** 04_Feat_UniversalCancellationSystem
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning

## Problem Statement
[Conversation Reference: User detailed "ssh_cancel_command MCP tool", "Browser Ctrl-C capture via WebSocket", "Cancel running command + clear entire queue (KISS approach)", "SSH2 library cancellation via stream.write('\x03') + stream.destroy()"]

Background tasks need universal cancellation capability from both MCP clients and browser users, with complete queue clearing and proper SSH process termination.

## Solution Approach
[Conversation Reference: User outlined dual cancellation sources with unified queue clearing]

Implement universal cancellation system supporting both MCP and browser cancellation sources, using SSH2 library termination methods and KISS approach for queue management.

## User Stories

### Story Breakdown
- [ ] **01_Story_MCPCancellationTool** - Implement ssh_cancel_command MCP tool
- [ ] **02_Story_BrowserCancellationCapture** - Capture browser Ctrl-C via WebSocket
- [ ] **03_Story_UnifiedCancellationProcessing** - Process cancellations from both sources identically
- [ ] **04_Story_SSH2ProcessTermination** - Terminate SSH processes using SSH2 library methods

## Acceptance Criteria

### MCP Cancellation Tool
[Conversation Reference: User specified "ssh_cancel_command MCP tool"]

```gherkin
Given a background task is running in a session
When an MCP client calls ssh_cancel_command with sessionName
Then the running command is cancelled within 1 second
And the task state changes to 'cancelled'
And the entire session queue is cleared
```

### Browser Cancellation Capture
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Browser Ctrl-C capture via WebSocket"]

```gherkin
Given a user is viewing a terminal session in browser
When the user presses Ctrl-C
Then the cancellation is captured via WebSocket
And the running command is cancelled identically to MCP cancellation
And browser receives cancellation confirmation
```

### Unified Queue Clearing
[Conversation Reference: User specified "Cancel running command + clear entire queue (KISS approach)"]

```gherkin
Given cancellation is triggered from any source
When cancellation processing occurs
Then the active command is terminated
And the entire session command queue is cleared
And no queued commands remain for execution
```

### SSH2 Process Termination
[Conversation Reference: User specified "SSH2 library cancellation via stream.write('\x03') + stream.destroy()"]

```gherkin
Given a command is executing via SSH
When cancellation is processed
Then stream.write('\x03') is sent to interrupt the process
And stream.destroy() is called to terminate the connection
And proper cleanup of SSH resources occurs
```

## Technical Implementation

### Cancellation Architecture
[Conversation Reference: Based on user's universal cancellation design]

- **Dual Input Sources**: Accept cancellation from MCP tools and WebSocket
- **Unified Processing**: Single cancellation processing pipeline
- **SSH2 Integration**: Use SSH2 library methods for process termination
- **Queue Management**: Clear entire session queue on cancellation

### MCP Tool Implementation
```typescript
const sshCancelCommandTool: Tool = {
  name: "ssh_cancel_command",
  description: "Cancel running command in SSH session and clear queue",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      sessionName: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Name of the SSH session"
      }
    },
    required: ["sessionName"]
  }
};
```

### WebSocket Cancellation Handling
[Conversation Reference: User specified browser Ctrl-C capture]

- **Ctrl-C Detection**: Detect Ctrl-C keystrokes in browser terminal
- **WebSocket Messaging**: Send cancellation messages via WebSocket
- **Message Processing**: Process browser cancellation messages
- **Response Notification**: Send cancellation confirmation to browser

## Dependencies
**Requires**: Features 1, 2, and 3 must be completed
**Integrates**: All previous features for complete cancellation capability

## Testing Strategy

### Cancellation Source Testing
- **MCP Cancellation**: Test ssh_cancel_command tool functionality
- **Browser Cancellation**: Test Ctrl-C capture and processing
- **Unified Behavior**: Verify identical behavior from both sources

### Process Termination Testing
- **SSH2 Integration**: Test SSH2 library termination methods
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verify proper cleanup of SSH resources
- **Queue Clearing**: Test complete queue clearing functionality

## Success Criteria

### Universal Cancellation
✅ **MCP Cancellation**: ssh_cancel_command tool cancels tasks and clears queues
✅ **Browser Cancellation**: Ctrl-C cancellation works identically to MCP
✅ **Unified Processing**: Both sources use identical cancellation processing
✅ **SSH2 Termination**: Proper SSH process termination using SSH2 methods

### System Integration
✅ **Queue Clearing**: Complete session queue clearing on cancellation
✅ **State Management**: Proper task state transition to 'cancelled'
✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Clean SSH resource cleanup and connection termination
✅ **Notification System**: Cancellation notifications to appropriate interfaces

## Risk Mitigation

### Cancellation Reliability
- **Process Termination**: Ensuring processes are actually terminated
  - *Mitigation*: SSH2 library integration and proper signal handling
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensuring proper cleanup of SSH resources
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive cleanup procedures and error handling

### System Stability
- **Queue State Consistency**: Maintaining consistent queue state after cancellation
  - *Mitigation*: Atomic queue operations and state validation
- **WebSocket Communication**: Reliable WebSocket communication for browser cancellation
  - *Mitigation*: Robust WebSocket handling and error recovery
