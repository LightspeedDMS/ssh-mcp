# Feature: Universal Command Cancellation

## Feature Overview
**Feature ID:** 02_Feat_UniversalCommandCancellation
**Epic:** LongRunningCommandSupport
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-09-15

## Feature Description
Implement universal command cancellation capability that allows MCP clients to cancel any running command, regardless of who initiated it (MCP or browser). This includes proper signal handling, process termination, browser notification system, and state cleanup to ensure system consistency.

## Business Value
### Problem Addressed
Currently, long-running commands cannot be cancelled, forcing users to wait for completion or terminate entire sessions. This blocks productivity and prevents recovery from runaway processes or mistaken command execution.

### Solution Provided
- Universal cancellation authority for MCP clients
- Graceful command termination with proper cleanup
- Browser users receive real-time cancellation notifications
- System resources freed immediately upon cancellation

## Technical Design
### Architecture Components
1. **Simple Cancellation API**: ssh_cancel_running_command handler
2. **SSH Channel Signal**: Send cancellation via SSH channel
3. **Browser Notification**: Send specific cancellation message
4. **Session State Update**: Set lastState to 'cancelled'

### Cancellation Flow
```
MCP Cancel Request → Validate Session → Send Signal via SSH → Update State → Notify Browser
```

## User Stories

### Story Breakdown
[ ] **01_Story_MCPCancellationCapability** - Complete MCP cancellation functionality
[ ] **02_Story_BrowserCancellationNotification** - Browser notification system

### Story Dependencies
1. MCPCancellationCapability provides core functionality
2. BrowserCancellationNotification depends on cancellation events

## Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Feature: Universal Command Cancellation
  As a system administrator
  I want to cancel any running command via MCP
  So that I can recover from long-running or problematic commands

  Scenario: MCP cancels MCP-initiated command
    Given an MCP client started command "sleep 300"
    When another MCP client requests cancellation
    Then the command is terminated within 3 seconds
    And the state changes to "cancelled"
    And resources are freed immediately

  Scenario: MCP cancels browser-initiated command
    Given a browser user started command "find / -name '*.log'"
    When an MCP client calls ssh_cancel_running_command with sessionName
    Then the browser receives cancellation notification
    And the terminal shows "[CANCELLED] Command terminated by MCP client"
    And the command stops producing output

  Scenario: Command termination via SSH
    Given a command is running in session "test-session"
    When cancellation is requested with sessionName
    Then cancellation signal is sent via SSH channel
    And the command terminates within 1 second
    And session.lastState is set to "cancelled"
```

## Implementation Requirements
### API Specifications
1. **ssh_cancel_running_command**
   - Accept sessionName parameter only
   - Return cancellation status
   - Simple success/error response

2. **WebSocket Notification**
   - Send "[CANCELLED] Command terminated by MCP client"
   - Broadcast to connected browser immediately

### Technical Constraints
- Cancellation response time: <3 seconds
- Process cleanup: 100% complete
- WebSocket notification: <100ms
- State consistency: Atomic updates

## Testing Strategy
### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Cancellation**
   - Cancel simple sleep command
   - Cancel output-generating command
   - Cancel CPU-intensive command

2. **Cross-Origin Cancellation**
   - MCP cancels MCP command
   - MCP cancels browser command
   - Multiple cancellation attempts

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Cancel already completed command
   - Cancel during state transition
   - Network interruption during cancellation

### Test Commands
```bash
# Primary test command
sleep 120

# Alternative test
sleep 65

# Quick test
sleep 30
```

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- Process management system
- Signal handling infrastructure
- WebSocket communication layer
- Session state management

### Feature Dependencies
- Requires Feature 1 (async mode) for state management
- Command execution pipeline modifications
- Browser terminal WebSocket integration

## Risk Mitigation
### Identified Risks
1. **Zombie Processes**
   - Risk: Processes not fully terminated
   - Mitigation: Process group management

2. **State Corruption**
   - Risk: Inconsistent state after cancellation
   - Mitigation: Atomic state transitions

3. **Signal Handling Issues**
   - Risk: Signals not properly delivered
   - Mitigation: Multiple termination strategies

## Success Metrics
- Cancellation success rate: >99%
- Average cancellation time: <2 seconds
- Zombie process rate: 0%
- WebSocket delivery rate: >99.9%
- State consistency: 100%

## Documentation Requirements
- API documentation for cancellation endpoint
- Signal handling behavior guide
- Browser integration documentation
- Troubleshooting guide for stuck processes

## Release Criteria
- All cancellation scenarios tested
- Browser notifications working
- Process cleanup verified
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation complete
