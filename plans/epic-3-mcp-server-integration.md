# Epic 3: MCP Server Integration

## Epic Intent
Implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server framework integration that exposes SSH functionality as MCP tools, enabling Claude Code to interact with remote servers through standardized MCP interfaces.

## Story 1: MCP Server Foundation
As a developer integrating with Claude Code, I want an MCP server that properly implements the MCP specification so that Claude Code can discover and use SSH tools.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the MCP server implementation is started
- **When** Claude Code connects to the server
- **Then** the server responds to MCP handshake requests correctly
- **And** server capabilities are advertised according to MCP specification
- **And** the server implements required MCP message types (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)
- **And** the server provides proper error handling for malformed requests
- **And** the server maintains connection state with Claude Code
- **And** server logging captures all MCP interactions for debugging

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk TypeScript library
- Implement proper JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging
- Support both stdio and TCP transport methods

## Story 2: SSH Connection Tool Implementation
As a Claude Code user, I want an MCP tool to establish SSH connections so that I can create named persistent sessions with remote servers.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the MCP server is running and connected to Claude Code
- **When** Claude Code calls the ssh_connect tool
- **Then** the tool accepts parameters: name (string), host (string), credentials (object)
- **And** credentials support SSH key authentication and password authentication
- **And** the tool validates all required parameters are provided
- **And** a new SSH connection is established using the provided credentials
- **And** the connection is stored with the provided name identifier
- **And** success response includes connection status and session details
- **And** error responses provide specific failure reasons
- **And** duplicate connection names are rejected with clear error messages

**Parameter Validation:**
- name: required, alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores only
- host: required, valid hostname or IP address
- credentials: required, must include either keyFile path or password

## Story 3: Command Execution Tool Implementation
As a Claude Code user, I want an MCP tool to execute bash commands on remote servers so that I can run development operations through SSH sessions.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** an active SSH session exists with a specific name
- **When** Claude Code calls the ssh_exec tool
- **Then** the tool accepts parameters: sessionName (string), command (string), workingDir (optional string)
- **And** the command is executed in the specified SSH session
- **And** the working directory is changed if workingDir parameter is provided
- **And** command output (stdout and stderr) is captured completely
- **And** the command exit code is returned in the response
- **And** terminal state (working directory, environment) persists after execution
- **And** error responses are provided for invalid session names
- **And** long-running commands are supported without timeout issues

**Performance Requirements:**
- Commands must begin execution within 2 seconds
- Output must be captured completely regardless of size
- Support commands that run for up to 30 minutes

## Story 4: Session Management Tools
As a Claude Code user, I want MCP tools to manage SSH sessions so that I can list, monitor, and disconnect sessions as needed.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** SSH sessions may be active
- **When** Claude Code calls session management tools
- **Then** ssh_list_sessions tool returns all active sessions with status information
- **And** each session includes: name, host, status, lastActivity, connectionTime
- **And** ssh_get_session_url tool returns monitoring URL for a specific session
- **And** ssh_disconnect tool closes a specific session by name
- **And** ssh_session_status tool provides detailed status for a single session
- **And** all tools validate session names exist before operations
- **And** tools provide consistent error messages for invalid sessions

## Story 5: Tool Error Handling and Validation
As a Claude Code user, I want robust error handling from MCP tools so that I receive clear feedback when operations fail.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** MCP tools are called with various inputs
- **When** invalid parameters or error conditions occur
- **Then** tools return proper MCP error responses with specific error codes
- **And** error messages are descriptive and actionable
- **And** parameter validation occurs before expensive operations
- **And** network connectivity issues are handled gracefully
- **And** SSH authentication failures provide clear error messages
- **And** session management errors distinguish between different failure types
- **And** all errors are logged for debugging purposes

**Error Categories:**
- INVALID_PARAMS: Parameter validation failures
- CONNECTION_ERROR: SSH connection establishment issues  
- SESSION_NOT_FOUND: Operations on non-existent sessions
- AUTHENTICATION_FAILED: SSH credential issues
- NETWORK_ERROR: Connectivity problems

## Story 6: MCP Tool Documentation and Schema
As a Claude Code integration, I want properly documented MCP tool schemas so that the system can understand tool capabilities and parameters.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** Claude Code requests tool information
- **When** the MCP server provides tool schemas
- **Then** each tool has complete parameter documentation
- **And** parameter types, required/optional status, and descriptions are specified
- **And** tool descriptions clearly explain functionality and use cases
- **And** example usage patterns are included in tool documentation
- **And** return value schemas are documented
- **And** error conditions and codes are documented
- **And** schemas validate successfully against MCP specification

## Story 7: Configuration and Startup Management
As a system administrator, I want configurable MCP server settings so that I can customize behavior for different environments.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the MCP server needs to be configured
- **When** the server starts up
- **Then** configuration is loaded from environment variables and config files
- **And** web server port for monitoring is configurable (default: 8080)
- **And** SSH connection timeouts are configurable (default: 30 seconds)
- **And** maximum concurrent sessions limit is configurable (default: 10)
- **And** log level is configurable (debug, info, warn, error)
- **And** invalid configuration values prevent server startup with clear error messages
- **And** configuration validation occurs at startup

**Configuration Parameters:**
- WEB_PORT: monitoring interface port
- SSH_TIMEOUT: connection timeout in seconds
- MAX_SESSIONS: maximum concurrent SSH sessions
- LOG_LEVEL: logging verbosity level
