# Epic 4: Security and Session Management

## Epic Intent
Implement comprehensive security measures and robust session management to ensure secure SSH operations, credential protection, and reliable connection handling across the MCP server lifecycle.

## Story 1: SSH Credential Management
As a developer using the SSH MCP server, I want secure credential storage and management so that my SSH authentication information is protected.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** SSH credentials need to be stored for connections
- **When** credentials are provided to the system
- **Then** SSH private keys are loaded from secure file system locations only
- **And** private key file permissions are validated (600 or more restrictive)
- **And** passwords are never logged or stored in plain text
- **And** credential validation occurs before connection attempts
- **And** invalid key files are rejected with clear error messages
- **And** key passphrases are supported for encrypted private keys
- **And** credential information is cleared from memory after use

**Security Requirements:**
- Private key files must have 600 permissions or more restrictive
- No credential information in log files or error messages
- Support for RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519 key types

## Story 2: Connection Authentication Handling
As a developer establishing SSH connections, I want robust authentication mechanisms so that I can securely connect to remote servers with various authentication methods.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** SSH connection authentication is required
- **When** authentication is attempted
- **Then** SSH key authentication is tried first if key is provided
- **And** password authentication is used as fallback if configured
- **And** authentication failures provide specific error types (key rejected, password invalid, etc.)
- **And** multiple authentication methods can be attempted in sequence
- **And** host key verification prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **And** known_hosts file is consulted for host key validation
- **And** authentication timeouts prevent indefinite hanging

**Security Requirements:**
- Host key verification must be enabled
- Authentication timeout maximum of 30 seconds
- Failed authentication attempts are logged for security monitoring

## Story 3: Session Isolation and Security
As a developer with multiple SSH sessions, I want proper session isolation so that sessions cannot interfere with each other and security boundaries are maintained.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** multiple SSH sessions are active
- **When** sessions are operating concurrently
- **Then** each session maintains isolated working directories
- **And** environment variables are isolated between sessions
- **And** process trees are isolated per session
- **And** file system access is restricted to user permissions on remote host
- **And** session memory is isolated and cleaned up on disconnect
- **And** one session cannot read or modify another session's state
- **And** session identifiers are unique and non-guessable

## Story 4: Connection Timeout and Recovery
As a developer with long-running SSH sessions, I want automatic connection recovery so that temporary network issues don't disrupt my development workflow.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** SSH connections may experience network interruptions
- **When** connection issues occur
- **Then** connection health is monitored with configurable intervals (default: 30 seconds)
- **And** failed connections trigger automatic reconnection attempts
- **And** exponential backoff is used between reconnection attempts (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 60s)
- **And** maximum reconnection attempts are configurable (default: 5)
- **And** session state is preserved during reconnection attempts
- **And** commands in progress are marked as interrupted
- **And** users are notified of connection status changes

**Recovery Requirements:**
- Initial reconnection attempt within 5 seconds of failure
- Session state preservation for up to 10 minutes during reconnection
- Clear status reporting during recovery process

## Story 5: Resource Management and Limits
As a system administrator, I want resource controls on SSH sessions so that the MCP server operates within defined limits and prevents resource exhaustion.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** SSH sessions consume system resources
- **When** sessions are created and operated
- **Then** maximum concurrent sessions limit is enforced (configurable, default: 10)
- **And** memory usage per session is monitored and limited
- **And** long-running commands have configurable timeout limits (default: 1 hour)
- **And** output buffer sizes are limited to prevent memory exhaustion (max 10MB per session)
- **And** inactive sessions are automatically cleaned up after timeout (default: 4 hours)
- **And** resource usage metrics are available for monitoring
- **And** resource limit violations are logged and reported

**Resource Limits:**
- Max sessions: 10 (configurable)
- Max command runtime: 1 hour (configurable)
- Max output buffer: 10MB per session
- Session idle timeout: 4 hours (configurable)

## Story 6: Audit Logging and Security Monitoring
As a security-conscious developer, I want comprehensive logging of SSH operations so that I can monitor security events and troubleshoot issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** SSH operations are performed through the MCP server
- **When** security-relevant events occur
- **Then** all connection attempts are logged with timestamps and source information
- **And** authentication failures are logged with failure reasons
- **And** command executions are logged with session context
- **And** connection state changes are logged
- **And** security violations (invalid credentials, failed host key verification) are prominently logged
- **And** log entries include session identifiers for correlation
- **And** sensitive information (passwords, private keys) is never included in logs

**Audit Requirements:**
- Structured logging format (JSON) for security analysis
- Log rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion
- Configurable log levels for different deployment environments

## Story 7: Session Cleanup and Graceful Shutdown
As a system operator, I want proper cleanup of SSH sessions so that resources are released and remote connections are closed cleanly.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** SSH sessions need to be terminated
- **When** session cleanup occurs (manual disconnect, timeout, server shutdown)
- **Then** active SSH connections are closed gracefully
- **And** running commands are terminated with SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL after timeout
- **And** temporary files and session state are cleaned up
- **And** monitoring WebSocket connections are closed
- **And** memory allocated to sessions is released
- **And** cleanup completion is logged
- **And** server shutdown waits for active session cleanup (max 30 seconds)

**Cleanup Requirements:**
- Graceful command termination with 10-second timeout before force kill
- Complete cleanup within 30 seconds
- No resource leaks after session termination

## Story 8: Security Configuration Validation
As a system administrator, I want security configuration validation so that the SSH MCP server operates with secure defaults and rejects insecure configurations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the MCP server is starting up with configuration
- **When** security-related configuration is processed
- **Then** SSH protocol version 2 is enforced (no SSHv1)
- **And** weak cipher suites are disabled
- **And** host key verification cannot be disabled
- **And** minimum key sizes are enforced (RSA 2048+, ECDSA 256+)
- **And** insecure configuration values prevent server startup
- **And** security configuration warnings are logged at startup
- **And** default values prioritize security over convenience

**Security Standards:**
- SSH protocol version 2 only
- Strong cipher suites (AES-256, ChaCha20)
- Host key verification mandatory
- Minimum RSA key size 2048 bits
